Headline,News,SentimentThe Bears Still Rule Oil Markets.html,"Nowadays, the oil bulls can’t seem to catch a proper break. Just when the markets were beginning to warm up to the idea that a large stimulus package by Beijing would boost demand by the world’s largest crude importer (buy on the rumor), oil prices have been badly hammered after the actual thing underwhelmed (sell on the news). The markets have thrown a strop after the People's Bank of China cut two benchmark lending rates by a mere 10 basis points each, seen as too small to make a difference. “On their own, 10 bps cuts are too small to make a great deal of difference to monetary conditions, especially since market interbank rates are already below policy rates,” Capital Economics’ Julian Evans-Pritchard and Zichun Huang said in a note China’s economic recovery has been less than impressive, and the initial excitement in the oil markets has been tamped down by a harsher reality. China’s industrial recovery has not been up to par and has fared worse than consumer-facing sectors. The transport sector has also been unimpressive with trucking activity failing to pick up as expected. Jet fuel demand has been disappointing with international flights from China only at 39% of pre-pandemic levels. Immediately after the Covid rules were relaxed, Chinese refiners went on a crude oil buying spree betting on a quick return to downstream demand. But that has failed to materialize leading to onshore inventories climbing to a two-year high. The current economic outlook is not good, either. Bloomberg has reported that China’s credit demand weakened in May as the economy’s recovery lost steam. Aggregate financing fell to 1.6 trillion yuan ($224 billion) in May, considerably lower than the median estimate of 1.9 trillion yuan. And, the shorts have become unrelenting. A month ago, Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman sent a warning to speculators, telling them to ‘watch out.’ Apparently, short sellers did not get the memo: commodity analysts at Standard Chartered have reported that speculative funds have continued to amass positions on the short side of the market despite a broader lack of trend. According to the experts, speculative shorts across the four main Brent and WTI contracts climbed by 16.5 million barrels (mb) w/w to a 31-month high of 251.7mb while longs declined by 3.8mb to 451.2mb. The speculative net long represents 4.2% of open interest, the lowest level since November 2009. The analysts have argued that current oil fundamentals and/or macroeconomics are not weak enough to justify a 31-month high in speculative shorts as well as a 13-year low in net speculative positioning.  Related: Eni To Buy Neptune Energy For $4.9 Billion Oil Experts More Bullish Luckily, the majority of oil experts are much more bullish on the oil price outlook. Commodity experts at Standard Chartered have created a heatmap of demand forecast changes, including their own, in the latest reports relative to one and three months ago. You will notice that the heatmap provides a positive view of demand, with most estimates for 2023 quarters and the annual average having moved higher over both time periods. Interestingly, the biggest upwards revisions have come from the more bearish agencies namely StanChart and the EIA, while more bullish ones including the IEA and OPEC Secretariat have not changed significantly. In sharp contrast, there’s a disconnect between what energy economists are seeing in the data and what speculative traders are acting on. Oil prices have touched multi-year lows on several occasions over the past months, with StanChart speculating that the disconnect could be the result of the increasingly top-down and macro-led nature of oil-market sentiment.  Source: Standard Chartered Research A week ago, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released its latest Monthly Oil Market Report, including the first MOMR forecasts for 2024. On the demand side, the IEA hiked its 2023 growth forecast by 240K barrels per day (kb/d) to 2.45mb/d, bringing its forecast in the ballpark of the OPEC Secretariat’s prediction of 2.346mb/d. Interestingly, U.S.-based Energy Information Administration (EIA) is more bearish than usual and sees demand growing just 1.591mb/d while Standard Chartered is the least bullish and has predicted growth of 1.508mb/d. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT The tables turn when it comes to predicting demand growth for 2024, with the EIA most bullish at 1.695mb/d; StanChart puts it at 1.538mb/d while the IEA is least bullish and sees demand growing just 0.86mb/d. In effect, the IEA has projected that demand will grow rapidly in 2023 followed by a sharp 2024 slowdown, while the EIA and StanChart’s forecasts show a flatter 2023 but no slowdown in 2024. However, readers will note that cumulative demand increase for 2023 and 2024 is very similar across the three forecasts (IEA: 3.31mb/d; EIA: 3.29mb/d; Standard Chartered: 3.05mb/d).  According to the IEA, demand slowdown will come from China (from 1.49mb/d in 2023 to 0.46mb/d in 2024), the Middle East (200kb/d in 2023, 60kb/d in 2024) and the U.S. (70kb/d in 2023, -230kb/d in 2024).",NegMiddle East Oil Prices Soar Amid Chinese Trading Frenzy.html,"At a time when global recession concerns have depressed global oil prices to pre-Ukraine war levels, prices of Middle Eastern oil have skyrocketed on soaring demand from Asian refiners in China to Japan as the market takes stock of heavy trading by the industry’s biggest names this month. According to Bloomberg, spot differentials for August-loading Oman crude have jumped to more than $2 a barrel against the Dubai benchmark as of Wednesday, compared with 60-70 cents last week; premiums for Abu Dhabi’s Murban grade also rose - it’s rare for spot differentials to move more than 10-to-20 cents a barrel between days and deals.  The soaring regional prices have been underpinned by Asian refiners snapping up barrels over the past couple of days, including China’s Rongsheng Petrochemical, Taiwan’s Formosa Petrochemical and processors in Japan and Thailand, according to traders. A surge in activity on a normally sedate Middle Eastern crude-trading window has also sparked the interest of market participants. For those asking where is all that pent up oil demand out of a post-covid China, here is your answer: Unipec - a unit of China’s top refiner Sinopec - TotalEnergies SE and Shell Plc have been going head-to-head with aggressive bids and offers of Dubai crude partial contracts on the so-called Platts trading window this month, an activity that goes into pricing a benchmark of the same name. As Bloomberg explains, cargoes of crude including Oman, Murban and other Middle Eastern grades can be delivered from seller to buyer following the transaction of a set number of Dubai partials. Shipments are typically 500,000 barrels and Oman is one of the easiest to handle due to its high export volume and large pool of buyers and sellers. So far this month, almost 40 Oman cargoes and two Upper Zakum shipments from the United Arab Emirates have been delivered, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, which is the most activity seen on the Platts window in years. However, the number of Oman shipments equates to almost 70% of the grade’s exported volume in recent months. That’s led traders to consider whether sellers on the Platts window such as Unipec may curtail offers should physical cargoes become scarce. These concerns have contributed to a rise in prices, and may give room for more increases if sellers find it hard to get their hands on window-deliverable cargoes. The sharp increase in sentiment (and price) is a dramatic turnaround from earlier in the month when traders were unsure about the market’s direction following contrasting trading on the window. Companies may also actively buy and sell on the window due to associated positions in Brent and Dubai paper markets. The backwardation in prompt Dubai swaps also strengthened to the widest in six weeks Wednesday, while the premium of London’s Brent to the Middle Eastern benchmark — also known as Brent-Dubai EFS — was narrow at under $1 a barrel. Earlier this month, Saudi Arabia surprised the market with additional output cuts that were followed by a spike in official prices to all regions. Bloomberg notes that last month cargoes of Oman, Upper Zakum and Murban crude for July loading were transacted for Europe and the US, shipments considered unusual, as Asian demand was soft at the time but that has since reversed notably. A US major sold Murban into the US west coast, traders said, while a trading company supplied Upper Zakum to Italy. Western buyers considered spot Middle Eastern crude as affordable due to muted demand from Asia, where many refiners were undergoing seasonally planned maintenance work on plants, according to traders. It now appears that China is fully back in the market.ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT",PosOil Falls Despite Moderate Draw In Crude Inventories.html,"Crude oil prices were little changed today after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported an inventory decline of 3.8 million barrels for the week to June 16. At 463.3 million barrels, the EIA said, inventories were around the five-year average for this time of the year. Last week’s inventory level change compared with a substantial build of almost 8 million barrels estimated for the previous week. In fuels, the authority estimated modest inventory builds. Gasoline stocks added 500,000 barrels in the week to June 16, after a build of 2.1 million barrels for the previous week. Gasoline production averaged 9.8 million bpd last week, which compared with 10.2 million bpd for the previous week. Middle distillate stocks rose by 400,000 barrels in the week to June 16, which compared with a build of 2.1 million barrels for the previous week. Middle distillate production last week averaged 5.1 million barrels daily, which compared with 5 million barrels daily for the previous week, the EIA also said. Meanwhile, as summer driving season moves into full swing, gasoline prices are on the decline, likely to stimulate greater demand during this peak season. China’s slower than expected recovery, Russia’s resilient oil exports and concern about a global recession have all combined to press prices at the pump lower, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month. Speaking of prices, crude oil inched up in the early hours of Wednesday, driven by expectations of a hawkish speech by Fed chair Jerome Powell when he gives his half-year testimony to Congress on Wednesday and Thursday. ""We expect Fed Chair Powell to deliver a hawkish semi-annual testimony to Congress reflecting the FOMC's median projection for higher interest rates in coming months and more resilient inflation in the near term,"" ANZ said in a note as quoted by Reuters.ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT At the time of writing, Brent crude was trading at $75.05 per barrel, with West Texas Intermediate at $70.46 per barrel, both down by close to 3% from opening.",NegCan Colombias Oil Industry Survive Petros Revolutionary Reforms.html,"The outlook for Colombia’s economically crucial oil industry is bleak. Not only has it failed to recover from the pandemic and return to a pre-2020 tempo of operations, but the July 2022 presidential electoral victory of former leftist guerilla Gustavo Petro sparked considerable concern over the oil industry’s future. Colombia’s first-ever left-wing president, who took office on August 7, 2023, plans to end awarding new contracts for hydrocarbon exploration and ban hydraulic fracturing. Those propositions form an important part of Petro’s energy transition and ending Colombia’s overreliance on hydrocarbons. While this policy is attracting substantial negative attention from various industry participants and financial markets, there are many credible reasons to decrease Colombia’s dependence on oil extraction. The primary headwind impacting Colombia’s hydrocarbon sector is a chronic lack of oil and natural gas reserves. Indeed, despite the considerable hype surrounding the Andean country’s hydrocarbon potential, there are signs Colombia does not share the oil resources of its regional neighbors like Brazil, Ecuador and Venezuela. At the end of 2022, it was determined that Colombia has meager proven hydrocarbon reserves (Spanish) of 2 billion barrels of oil and 2.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Those proven oil reserves are only sufficient to last another 7.5 years at the current rate of production, while the gas reserves will sustain just over seven years of production.  Of considerable concern is that Colombia’s reserve growth over the last two decades has come from minor oil discoveries and the adoption of improved recovery techniques at mature oilfields rather than world-class finds. A range of methods is being employed to improve oil recovery from Colombia’s aging mature onshore oil fields. The most common technique is waterflood or injection, which occurs after the primary recovery phase has ended. Waterflood is used to boost reservoir pressure making it more efficient and cost-effective to lift the crude oil contained within. Once secondary recovery no longer proves effective, then enhanced or tertiary recovery is employed. This typically consists of natural gas, nitrogen, carbon dioxide or chemical injection to bolster reservoir pressure and the oil’s viscosity, making it easier to extract. A popular tertiary recovery technique employed in Colombia is natural gas injection. The gas associated with oil production is captured by drillers and then reinjected in wells to bolster reservoir pressure and enhance recovery. This is one of the reasons for the Andean country’s constrained natural gas supply. Tertiary recovery is costly with their widespread deployment, as is occurring in Colombia, leading to high breakeven costs for each barrel of oil produced. It is estimated that Colombia’s average breakeven price is around $45. That was before Petro’s November 2022 tax hikes added a scalable levy that increases taxes payable as Brent prices rise and removed royalties as an income tax deduction, causing breakeven prices to increase. Improved recovery techniques are widely used in Colombia, where 80% of the Andean country’s oil output is sourced from aging mature oilfields with high decline rates and have passed their peak production. According to Energy Minister Irene Velez (Spanish), those oilfields, which are between 30 years to 100 years old, are still pumping significant commercial volumes of crude despite their age because of the use of improved recovery methods. It is the prolific Rubiales field, which commenced operations in 1988 and hit peak production a decade ago, that is Colombia’s most important oilfield pumping around 100,000 barrels per day. A range of improved recovery techniques is employed at the Rubiales field, which is operated by the national oil company Ecopetrol, to counter rising decline rates and bolster economically crucial oil production. Reserve growth through the employment of enhanced recovery techniques is unreliable and unsustainable, with a limited lifespan. This means for Colombia’s petroleum industry to have a sustainable long-term future then, hydrocarbon reserves must be boosted through major hydrocarbon discoveries. It is Colombia’s lack of exploration success since the 1990s when the country saw its last world-class oil discovery, which is responsible for the lack of hydrocarbon reserves and weighing heavily on the petroleum industry's outlook. For these reasons, Colombia’s considerable economic dependence on oil production despite lacking significant oil reserves, like Venezuela’s 303.5 billion barrels or Brazil’s nearly 13 billion barrels, leaves the country vulnerable to considerable turmoil. Data from Colombia’s government statistics agency DANE shows (Spanish) for the first four months of 2023, petroleum generated $4.8 billion of export income, making it the largest export by value and around 3% of gross domestic product (Spanish). Petroleum production is an important source of taxation income for a financially strained Bogota. In 2022, the oil industry contributed (Spanish) $4.5 billion in taxes or around 8% of the total tax revenue received by Colombia’s Tax and Customs National Authority (DIAN – Spanish initials) for that year. It is estimated that oil industry tax revenue combined with dividends received from state-controlled Ecopetrol is responsible for nearly a fifth of Bogota’s fiscal income. Taxes paid by Colombia’s oil industry for 2023 are expected to soar because of the oil industry tax hikes introduced by Petro, which were approved by Congress in November 2022. Colombia’s Autonomous Committee of the Fiscal Rule (CARF – Spanish initials) estimates that 2023 taxation revenue from the petroleum industry will rise by a whopping 72.5%, compared to a year earlier, to $7.7 billion. That will give government coffers a crucial boost at a time when the Petro administration is seeking to significantly increase spending on social programs in an effort to alleviate the sharp spike in poverty since 2022, with 39% of Colombians living below the poverty line. While those numbers emphasize how important oil extraction is to Colombia’s economy and government revenue, they also underscore the Andean country’s vulnerability to financial turmoil when oil reserves are no longer sufficient to support production. That highlights why Bogota must wean Colombia off its economic dependence on fossil fuels. If changes to the economic mix are not made soon, Colombia’s economy and its currency, the peso, which is closely correlated to the value of oil, are at risk as reserves and production decline. For that reason, Petro’s controversial plan to cease awarding new contracts for hydrocarbon exploration may be the solution if other economic sectors can fill the gap left by a shrinking oil industry.",NegHow Renewable Energy Prosumers Are Decentralizing The Power Grid.html,"The spread of renewable energy has changed the way that our grids operate. Variable energy sources such as wind and solar require major upgrades to the existing power grid that would allow for increased efficiency and flexibility. And it’s not just mass-scale solar and wind farms that are complicating the functionality of the grid. Energy generation is becoming increasingly decentralized and localized as people install residential solar panels, batteries, and other grid-connected residential infrastructure, creating challenges as well as opportunities for local and regional power grids. These individuals who provide energy to the local grid as well as consume energy from it are known as prosumers, and they are disrupting the energy grid as we know it.  The energy grid can be thought of as a massive ecosystem with a huge variety of organisms  – asset owners, manufacturers, service providers, and government officials at Federal, state, and local levels – and now decentralized and variable prosumers. And right now that ecosystem isn’t doing so hot. The grid in the U.S. is wholly unprepared for the renewable energy revolution. The International Energy Agency estimates that annual investments in energy sector infrastructure and technologies will need to increase four-fold from current levels to reach $4 trillion by 2030 in order to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. It’s a tall order, to say the least. In fact, it’s not even performing well in the current moment, as a higher frequency of extreme weather events attributed to climate change are causing increasingly frequent and long-lasting blackouts across the country. But updating the grid is far easier said than done. In fact, it’s a massively expensive slow-moving bureaucratic nightmare.   Related: UAE’s ADNOC Eyes Expansion Of Downstream Activity In Europe This roadblock has been the jumping off point for many innovative ideas for alternative ways of interacting with the grid, or of avoiding the grid entirely. New and imaginative energy systems such as decentralized microgrids, use of the blockchain to regulate and manage prosumer markets, and local energy communities have received increasing attention from private investors and public figures alike. One of the most promising ideas to arise from this hotbed of innovation is the concept of local energy markets (LEMs).  LEMs would allow prosumers to buy and sell energy amongst each other based on their individual needs via a trading platform managed by a local utility, which takes a percentage of every transaction. Advocates of LEMs praise this market-based approach. As Forbes recently reported, “This market layer ensures stability in frequency, voltage and other crucial power system attributes. Rather than relying on manual interventions, a sophisticated market-based system allows for price setting within predefined constraints, creating a self-regulating energy ecosystem.” The targeted outcome is a system in which diverse production and consumption needs can be accommodated while simultaneously stabilizing the power grid.  The idea is that LEM integration won’t only benefit the prosumers using the trading platform, it will benefit the grid as a whole. Forbes proclaims that LEMs “can facilitate the efficient utilization of local renewable resources, reduce strain on the grid during peak demand periods, help remove renewable subsidies like net metering and support the integration of distributed energy resources in an orderly fashion.” On top of all of those promising claims, a recent Guidehouse report touted LEMs’ ability to support the expansion of renewable energy uptake while creating a more flexible and stable grid.  While the conceptualization of LEMs is new, the idea is quite promising. A European LEM pilot project found that the system can indeed contribute to grid stability at the same time that increased renewable energies are integrated. But there are also some major barriers to LEM implementation. The current power system is not designed to facilitate such decentralized market trading – in many jurisdictions, the introduction of LEMs would require a major regulatory overhaul. In others, however, an incremental integration of LEMs within the existing framework could already be feasible.",NegAre Oil Prices Set for A Rally.html,"More than a million barrels daily in additional production cuts from OPEC+. Record crude oil imports from China. A bullish outlook for air travel, hence jet fuel demand, this year. Yet nothing seems to be able to move oil prices much higher than where they are stuck right now – between $70 and $75 per barrel. The bearish factors are clear and, indeed, significant: uncertainty about the pace of China’s economic rebound from the pandemic, despite the record rate of oil imports; and inflation and recession fears that seem to have become epidemic in incidence among commodity traders. There is also a third bearish factor at play—a new factor that was not around in previous industry cycles. That’s the energy transition and the dozens of forecasts saying that the shift to wind, solar, and EVs will kill oil demand. The latest in that bunch of forecasts came from the Canada Energy Regulator, no less. The CER used computer modeling to predict oil demand over the long term and found that a successful transition to a net-zero state of the global energy system would reduce oil demand by 65% by 2050. That’s quite a significant reduction, even if it’s not a complete “death” of demand. Meanwhile, however, the International Energy Agency said this month it expected oil demand growth to peak before 2030, again because of the transition. “The shift to a clean energy economy is picking up pace, with a peak in global oil demand in sight before the end of this decade as electric vehicles, energy efficiency and other technologies advance,” IEA chief Fatih Birol said. “Oil producers need to pay careful attention to the gathering pace of change and calibrate their investment decisions to ensure an orderly transition.”  Related: Energy Regulator Claims Canadian Oil Production Will Plunge 76% By 2050 With such a degree of certainty coming from organizations such as the IEA and the CER, many producers would indeed think twice about their growth plans. And this is what brings us to the greatest risk of the current situation with oil prices: a surge down the road, resulting from the market swinging into a deficit. This is not a new scenario. In fact, analysts have been warning about it for a while. According to recent data from Rystad Energy, that deficit could reach 2.4 million bpd over the second half of the year. Demand, meanwhile, will grow by 1.7 million bpd. Where exactly can oil prices reasonably go in such a context? Up. And they will go up as soon as traders discover the gap between supply and demand, and recall the fact that oil demand is quite inelastic because of the fundamental nature of the commodity. Oil is used in pretty much everything in one form or another. This means that whatever the price, demand will change little. For now, traders seem preoccupied with China’s return to normal, Europe’s recession and U.S. inflation, and seem to have forgotten that last fact. But at the same time, they are seeing stable oil exports from Russia despite its pledge to cut output by half a million barrels daily, higher oil exports from Iran, and lower-than-planned output cuts from OPEC+. There is, in other words, plenty of supply at the moment, as far as traders are concerned. And demand doesn’t seem like it will be picking up strongly anywhere anytime soon, at least based on mobility data. Global road traffic, Rystad reports, has recently fallen below 2019 levels in the past couple of weeks. Yet for the three months before that, it was above those levels. But here’s an interesting report from the IEA from last year. In mid-June 2022, the IEA predicted that the supply of crude oil would have to catch up with demand this year. “Global oil supply may struggle to keep pace with demand next year, as tighter sanctions force Russia to shut in more wells and a number of producers bump up against capacity constraints,” the IEA said in its June 2022 market report. We all saw how that turned out, and Russian exports are becoming something of a mystery because, Rystad again notes, Russia has indeed cut production—by about 400,000 bpd. This is lower than promised, but it’s not a little. Yet exports remain stronger than virtually everyone expected them to be.ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT This, and the apparently unsatisfactory pace of China’s economic growth, are the two factors keeping supply concerns in check. For now. Because sooner or later, the additional OPEC+ cuts will begin to be felt. There is a simple reason for that: demand will not be falling to any degree proportional to supply cuts. All this means that oil bulls could yet have their day later this year, especially as the northern hemisphere moves closer to winter and heating demand pushes oil demand higher. Summer driving season may be a good indicator of oil demand trends, but winter heating season is better. Traveling in the summer is a question of preference and means. Staying warm in the winter is a necessity.",NegVenezuela Defies Expectations As Economy Rebounds.html,"In less than a decade, the economy of what was once South America’s wealthiest country, Venezuela, collapsed. The oil-rich country, which once pumped over three million barrels of petroleum daily, slumped into the worst economic collapse of modern times to occur outside of war. For the decade between 2012 and 2022, Venezuela’s gross domestic product plummeted by a whopping 300%, falling from $372 billion to $93 billion. It wasn’t until 2021 that the OPEC member’s economy finally returned to growth after being almost destroyed by weaker oil prices, endemic corruption, declining petroleum production and harsh U.S. sanctions. In 2022, in an event that surprised many, Venezuela’s economy grew at its fastest rate in nearly 20 years, expanding by a stunning 8%. There are signs of further growth ahead as Venezuela’s economic backbone, the oil industry, recovers. Venezuela’s rapid economic decline can be attributed to a multitude of factors that were evident even before Hugo Chavez won the presidency and launched his Bolivarian socialist revolution in 1999. It was the OPEC founding member’s dependence on petroleum, which was, and still is, Venezuela’s primary economic driver, with oil rents by 1979 responsible for 36% of GDP, which is responsible not only for its wealth but also the country’s startlingly rapid and disastrous decline. Indeed, the 1980s oil price collapse, where the international Brent benchmark price by mid-1986 had plummeted to its lowest level in over a decade, triggered a crisis that shook Latin America’s most stable democracy to its core. In 1989, after the central government instituted a multitude of harsh neoliberal economic reforms aimed at stabilizing Venezuela’s oil-dependent economy and currency, the capital Caracas was engulfed by violent anti-government protests. After a brutal crackdown by security forces in Caracas, which saw up to 3,000 people killed, Venezuela was embroiled in endless political turmoil that caused democratic rule to unravel. It was in 1992 that the Venezuelan military launched two failed coup d'états, the first time since the 1960s, against the administration of democratically elected President Carlos Andrés Pérez Rodríguez. One of the military leaders of those coups, Hugo Chavez, went on to win the 1998 presidential election and take office in February 1999. President Chavez then promptly went on to implement a new constitution, overturn the democratic order and launch his socialist Bolivarian revolution. Just as it had been sharply weaker oil prices that had created the conditions which facilitated Chavez’s rise to power, it was the massive oil price rally from late-1999 to 2008 that allowed Venezuela’s 45th president to consolidate his power.  Chavez used the considerable profits created by Venezuela’s vast oil reserves and production to invest in social programs aimed at reducing poverty. That allowed the charismatic former military officer to build considerable popular support among Venezuela’s poor. It was Venezuela’s working poor who had suffered the most under the neoliberal economic reforms introduced during the late 1980s as oil prices collapsed and the country’s petroleum-dependent economy unraveled. Support for Chavez was so strong that even a 2002 military coup failed to unseat him, with the president returning to power after an absence of nearly two days. It was during Chavez’s tenure as president that the implosion of Venezuela’s oil industry and economic breakdown began. By 2008, when Brent peaked at over $143 per barrel, Venezuela was pumping 2.5 million barrels per day compared to 3.1 million barrels daily in 1998, the year before Chavez took power. It was endemic corruption, malfeasance and cronyism coupled with a massive outflow of skilled oil industry labor which was responsible for the ongoing decline in production. Foreign energy investment gradually declined as Chavez implemented waves of nationalization that saw state-controlled PDVSA not only cement control of the best energy assets but privately owned energy assets subsumed by the state. This acted as a major deterrent to foreign energy investment, further magnifying the shortages of skilled labor, technology and capital required for maintenance as well as asset development. Those events, coupled with volatile oil prices, which collapsed in late-2008 as the global financial crisis bit ever deeper, caused economic growth to decline steeply. After the economy grew by a healthy 5.3% during 2008, it slipped into a recession, with GDP shrinking by 3.2% in 2009 and again by 1.5% in 2010. Venezuela’s economic condition only worsened after Chavez died from cancer in 2013, and Nicolas Maduro emerged to take his place. It was the precipitous oil crash of late-2014, where Brent plunged to under $30 per barrel by early 2016, that again saw Venezuela’s economy sharply contract. GDP declined at an alarming rate over the next seven years as oil prices remained weak, contracting by double digits annually from 2015 to 2020 until returning to growth in 2022. For 2015, GDP plummeted by 6.2% year over year, then a whopping 17% in 2016, 15.7% in 2017 and 19.7% in 2018. It was the imposition of strict U.S. sanctions, designed to cut Caracas off from global financial and energy markets, by former President Donald Trump in 2019, combined with heavily corroded industry infrastructure, which caused that decline to accelerate. During 2019 alone, Venezuela’s GDP shrank by an alarming 27.7% and then 30% in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic hit Latin America particularly hard. During 2020, Venezuela’s oil production plummeted to a multidecade low of 392,000 barrels per day during July of that year. It wasn’t until 2021 that the economic crisis bottomed, and the economy returned to growth, with GDP expanding by a modest 0.5% and then 8% for 2022. This generated a sense of relief in Caracas, where collapsing oil production and a failing economy almost bankrupted the state, causing inflation to spiral out of control and authorities to lose control of vast swathes of national territory. Key to that economic recovery, which surprised many, was Caracas’ ability to boost oil production from that 2020 record low. That was achieved with the assistance provided by the important allies Russia, China and Iran. Indeed, it was Teheran’s provision of skilled oil industry technicians as well as parts, and a steady supply of crucial condensate is pivotal to PDVSA expanding hydrocarbon production. Condensate is crucial because the vast majority of the oil extracted by Venezuela is heavy and extra-heavy, which means it must be mixed with super light hydrocarbon liquids so that it can flow, allowing it to be transported, processed and exported. By May 2023, data from Caracas supplied to OPEC showed that Venezuela was lifting 819,000 barrels of oil per day, more than double the historic low recorded for July 2020 of 392,000 barrels daily. Venezuela’s hydrocarbon production will continue to rise. U.S. energy supermajor Chevron recommenced lifting oil from its joint ventures with PDVSA, with the company ramping up operations as it seeks to recoup $3 billion in debt by 2025. While PDVSA is unable to receive payment for the oil extracted by Chevron and shipped to the U.S., that activity will still deliver considerable economic benefit. Maduro’s regime plans to tap Venezuela’s vast natural gas reserves in a bid to drive continued economic growth and revive the flailing economy. The OPEC member has over 200 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves which are the 10th largest globally. Venezuela historically has made little effort to tap that vast hydrocarbon wealth with its vast oil reserves, a far more lucrative source of wealth. Over 80% of the country's natural gas reserves are associated with oil production, with it estimated that Venezuela wastes through flaring and leaks more of the fossil fuel than the UK produces annually. Reportedly, Caracas reached an agreement with Spain's Repsol and Italy's Eni to export natural gas to Europe. While this offers an enticing means of bolstering economic growth through the exploitation of Venezuela’s natural gas and using it to ease Europe’s shortage, it could still run afoul of U.S. sanctions.  Trinidad and Tobago was forced to acquire a U.S. license, which was granted by the Biden White House, to develop an offshore natural gas deposit located in Venezuelan territorial waters. By mid-2022, the Biden administration had authorized Repsol and Eni to receive shipments of Venezuelan crude oil, although both companies were blocked from making cash payments to PDVSA. That crude oil could only be received in exchange for the debt owed to both European energy companies. For these reasons, PDVSA is prevented from receiving cash payments for the sale of oil and unless exempted by the White House, will be incapable of receiving such benefits for the sale of natural gas. Such a move will deliver very little direct economic benefit for Caracas, making it difficult to see how the exploitation of Venezuela’s considerable natural gas reserves will drive further economic growth. While that may be the case, there are clear signs that Venezuela’s economic decline has bottomed and that GDP will continue to expand, albeit at a modest pace, with the International Monetary Fund estimating 5% growth for 2023.ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT",NegWTI Drops As Demand Fears Take Over Markets.html,"WTI crude prices slid on Tuesday morning to just above $70 per barrel—an important psychological threshold for the U.S. crude oil benchmark. WTI was trading at $70.16 per barrel at 11:34 a.m. ET, a $1.62 (2.26%) drop on the day, as renewed fears of immediate lackluster global demand pervaded the oil markets. The Brent crude oil benchmark also was trading down on Tuesday—by 1.47%, to below $75 per barrel at $74.99. The catalysts behind the moves are generally demand-based. In a show of no confidence in its economy, China slashed its main benchmark lending rates for the first time in nearly a year on Tuesday—by 10 basis points for its one-year loan prime rate. As crude oil’s number one importer, a weak Chinese economy spells trouble for global crude demand. Lending credence to China’s economic woes was Goldman Sachs’ Sunday forecast on China’s economy, which included phrases like “fizzled out” to refer to China’s post-Covid recovery. The demand concern doesn’t stop with China. The European Union has seen two consecutive quarters of economic contraction thanks to inflation and slowed consumer spending. Economic output in the EU fell during Q1, adding to the fears that a global slowdown could dent oil demand. The largest bearish factor, however, is OPEC+’s production quota cuts. While this would seem in theory to restrict crude oil supply, the move is a testament to the group’s likely outlook on crude oil demand—mainly crude oil demand from China. Meanwhile, U.S. crude oil production has rallied over the last two weeks to 12.4 million bpd, a rise of 200,000 bpd from the beginning of the year. WTI is still trading above the lows seen on June 14 and June 15, when the U.S. benchmark prices sagged to near $68 per barrel.",NegNew Oil Gas Agreements Expand Chinas Influence In Saudi Arabia.html,"From the moment that China offered Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS) a face-saving way out of the Saudi Aramco initial public offering disaster that he had created, as analysed in depth in my new book on the new global oil market order, the relationship between the two countries has grown ever stronger. Toward the end of last year, Saudi Arabia reiterated its commitment to China as its “most reliable partner and supplier of crude oil,” along with broader assurances of its ongoing support in several other areas. This followed the comment in March 2021 at the annual China Development Forum hosted in Beijing, from Aramco chief executive officer, Amin Nasser that: “Ensuring the continuing security of China’s energy needs remains our highest priority - not just for the next five years but for the next 50 and beyond.” Such statements appeared to confirm that MbS now sees the U.S. as a partner just for its security considerations in the new global oil market order, with no meaningful quid pro quo on Saudi Arabia’s part, whilst regarding China as its key partner economically and Russia as its key partner in energy matters. A slew of new commitments last week from Saudi Arabia to China appear to confirm these views.  To begin with, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said that the Kingdom is keen to cooperate further with China in developing gas ties, as well as those relating to crude oil. These gas ties will span the entire sector, from the development of reserves to new petrochemicals projects, and follow on from the signing last August of a multi-pronged memorandum of understanding (MoU) between Saudi Aramco and the China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (Sinopec). As the president of Sinopec, Yu Baocai, put it at the time: “The signing of the MoU introduces a new chapter of our partnership in the Kingdom [of Saudi Aabia] …The two companies will join hands in renewing the vitality and scoring new progress of the Belt and Road Initiative [BRI] and [Saudi Arabia’s] Vision 2030.” Crucially for China’s long-term plans in Saudi Arabia, it also covers opportunities for the construction of a huge manufacturing hub in King Salman Energy Park that will involve the ongoing, on-the-ground presence on Saudi Arabian soil of significant numbers of Chinese personnel. These will not just be directly related to the oil, gas, petrochemicals, and other hydrocarbons activities, but will also include a small army of security personnel to ensure the safety of China’s investments. At that point last year, Aramco already had a 25 percent stake in the 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) Fujian refinery in south China through a joint venture with Sinopec (and the U.S.’s ExxonMobil) and had also earlier agreed (in 2018) to buy a 9 percent stake in China’s 800,000 bpd ZPC refinery from Rongsheng.  Several other joint projects between China and Saudi Arabia that had been agreed in principle had been delayed due to a combination of factors at the time. These were the ongoing effects of COVID-19, Aramco’s crushing dividend repayment schedule, and concern from both countries – especially China – on how Washington might react to this clear threat to the U.S.’s own long-running relationship with Saudi Arabia, as also analysed in depth in my new book on the new global oil market order. The basis of this enduring relationship had been struck back in 1945 at a meeting on 14 February 1945 between the then-U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Saudi King at the time, Abdulaziz bin Abdul Rahman Al Saud. The deal that they agreed – which had been the basis for all the U.S.’s Middle East policy up until very recently - was this: the U.S. would receive all of the oil supplies it needed for as long as Saudi had oil in place, in return for which the U.S. would guarantee the security both of the ruling House of Saud and, by extension, of Saudi Arabia. This landmark deal survived the 1973 Oil Crisis and even looked as though it might survive the Saudi-led Oil Price War from 2014 to 2016, aimed by Riyadh at destroying or at least severely disabling the then-nascent U.S. shale oil industry. The real death of the 1945 Bitter Lake deal came when Russia emerged at the end of 2016 to support the then-beleaguered Saudi Arabia and OPEC in future oil production deals, given the lack of credibility in the global oil markets that both had at the end of the 2014-2016 Oil Price War. With the announcements last week, it seems that all the key elements of the previously-announced deals between Saudi Arabia and China are coming back into play. Just prior to the signing of the wide-ranging MoU in August 2022 – the precursor to last week’s agreements - Saudi Aramco’s senior vice president downstream, Mohammed Y. Al Qahtani, announced the creation of a ‘one-stop shop’ provided by his company in China’s Shandong. “The ongoing energy crisis [caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022], for example, is a direct result of fragile international transition plans which have arbitrarily ignored energy security and affordability for all,” he said. “The world needs clear-eyed thinking on such issues - that’s why we highly admire China’s 14th Five Year Plan for prioritising energy security and stability, acknowledging its crucial role in economic development,” he added. The megaproject in Shandong, which is home to around 26 percent of China’s refining capacity and is a key destination for Saudi Aramco’s crude oil exports, will broadly involve the flagship Saudi oil and gas giant creating “stronger ties with the world’s largest oil exporter [that] would enhance China’s energy security, especially as we work on increasing our production capacity to 13 million barrels per day,” according to Al Qahtani. Aside from the fact that Saudi Arabia still cannot produce anywhere near 13 million barrels per day of crude oil, as examined in detail in my new book, closer cooperation between Aramco and China will mean Saudi Arabia investing heavily in the build-out of a large, integrated downstream business across the country in tandem with its Chinese partners. A key facet of agreements made by emerging nations with China is that they tend to feature significant deal creep. As highlighted above, they all tend to feature the build-out by China of major facilities in the target countries that allow Beijing to station significant numbers of personnel – including those designated as security staff – in and around them. They also tend to act as the precursor to several other more insidious features that only become clearer as time progresses. In December 2022, MbS hosted a series of meetings in Riyadh between China’s President Xi Jinping and the leaders of countries in the Arab League. The Arab League comprises Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordon, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Palestinian Authority, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen. At this meeting – and the January 2022 meeting between senior officials from the Chinese government and foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, plus the secretary-general of the Gulf Cooperation Council (comprising Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) - the principal topics of conversation were to finally seal a China-GCC Free Trade Agreement and to forge a “deeper strategic cooperation in a region where U.S. dominance is showing signs of retreat”. Also at the December 2022 meetings, China’s President Xi Jinping identified two ‘priority areas’ that he believed should be addressed as quickly as possible, as also analysed in depth in my new book on the new global oil market order. The first was the transition to using the Chinese renminbi in oil and gas deals done between the Arab League countries and China. The second was to bring nuclear technology to targeted countries, beginning with Saudi Arabia. Previously, the Kingdom had been in talks to acquire nuclear technology from the U.S. under the ‘1-2-3’ protocol. As highlighted in 2019 by then-US Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, Saudi Arabia had told the U.S. that it wanted to go ahead with a full-cycle nuclear programme, including the production and enrichment of uranium for atomic fuel. The U.S. had made it clear that for U.S. companies to participate in Saudi Arabia’s project, Riyadh would need to sign an accord on the peaceful use of nuclear technology with Washington. The ‘1-2-3’ protocol was intended to limit the enrichment of uranium for arms purposes. China does not have such a protocol in place for Saudi Arabia. And, as Saudi Arabia’s energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman again reiterated last week: “We came to recognise the reality of today that China has taken a lead and will continue to take that lead […] We do not have to compete with China, we have to collaborate with China.”",NeutralDiesel Demand Defies Recession Fears.html,"Continued tightness in middle distillate inventories globally is balancing recession fears among commodity traders, pushing them to bet on fuel futures even as they exit crude oil. Reuters’ market analyst John Kemp reported this week that institutional traders had sold the equivalent of 21 million barrels of crude in futures but had bought the equivalent of 14 million barrels of middle distillates in futures in the week ending June 13. Meanwhile, in a sign of continued strong demand for distillate fuels such as diesel, Reuters reported that China’s diesel fuel exports had increased fourfold in May. The report noted weaker demand at home, which could have discouraged traders from oil and fuels altogether, yet growing exports suggest strong demand elsewhere, prompting a greater appetite for fuel buys. China exported 600,000 metric tons of diesel last month, up from 120,000 metric tons in May 2022, the report said, with gasoline exports also surging, by 67%, to 1.36 million tons. Europe is one obvious destination for Chinese diesel. After banning Russian crude and fuels, the continent has not exactly been able to stop using them. It has just had to find new suppliers, and China has emerged as a big one among them, along with India. Saudi Arabia has somewhat surprisingly joined the ranks of diesel exporters to Europe despite its popularity as a crude oil exporter. The Kingdom has been buying a lot of Russian diesel and exporting its own diesel to Europe. In April, Saudi Arabia became the second-biggest exporter of diesel and gas oil in the world. Perhaps the consistent demand for fuels is among the reasons who commodity futures traders have increased their positions in European gas oil in five of the last six weeks, according to Reuters’ Kemp. The cumulative increase since late May has reached the equivalent of 24 million barrels. Meanwhile, Argus reported that the premium, at which European diesel is trading to dated Brent in northwestern Europe, has been on the rise, reinforcing the perception of strong fuel demand despite the eurozone recession. On June 15, the premium hit $24 per barrel, Argus noted, adding this was the highest gap between dated Brent and diesel since the end of March. In Europe, stocks of distillate fuels have at the same time declined, further pointing to healthy demand. Globally, these remain tight despite the economic slowdown that sparked fears of a recession and the decimation of oil demand. Reuters’ Kemp again noted that in a recent column, noting that distillate stocks in Europe were 32 million barrels higher at the end of May than the trough they’d reached a year ago but that they were still 32 million barrels below the 10-year seasonal average. In the United States, Kemp reported, distillate stocks were 5 million barrels higher now than a year ago, but they were 22 million barrels lower than the 10-year average for this time of the year. At the same time, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said that diesel fuel consumption in the United States, except the West Coast, had climbed above the 10-year maximum in March. The exception was attributed to greater biodiesel consumption on the West Coast rather than lower demand.ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT It appears, then, that even with an economic slowdown, an uneven post-pandemic recovery in China, and an actual recession in much of Europe, demand for fuels remains robust enough to push prices higher and entice traders to buy more futures in that segment. Perhaps the fears for oil demand that have been gripping the market for months may have been premature.",PosA Look At South Americas Top 5 Economies And Their Oil Potential.html,"Recent discoveries in offshore Guyana and Suriname have brought the spotlight firmly back on South America’s hydrocarbon sector, with analysts calling the Guyana Suriname Basin as the world’s most exciting frontier oil play. Exxon’s more than 35 oil discoveries in offshore Guyana have delivered a tremendous economic dividend for the impoverished country, which emerged as the world’s fastest-growing economy. Despite these events, Guyana, in comparison to South America’s leading economies and oil-producing countries, is still a relative minnow. It is the continent’s largest economy Brazil which is leading the charge and is tipped to become the world’s fourth-largest oil producer by 2029. With the exception of Chile, where metal mining reigns supreme, petroleum production is a key driver for the continent’s five largest economies. The Andean country of Peru reported a 2022 gross domestic product of $242 billion, which ranks it as South America’s fifth-largest economy. While the country is believed to possess considerable oil potential, a combination of factors, including a long-running political crisis, anti-petroleum industry protests and a deteriorating social license, have made it near impossible to effectively exploit that hydrocarbon wealth. At the end of 2021, Peru had proven oil reserves of 244 million barrels which represents a 19% decline compared to a year earlier. Those are also some of the lowest reserves of any oil-producing nation in South America, including being significantly less than neighboring Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil and Venezuela. A combination of a sharp fall in investment because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing political crisis in Lima and frequent anti-oil industry protests, notably in Peru’s Amazon, are weighing on exploration as well as production. For May 2023, Peru only lifted 41,652 barrels per day, which was 2% less than a month prior and 8% lower year over year. Anti-oil industry protects by indigenous communities in Peru’s Amazon remains a constant threat. At this time, The Indigenous Association for Development and Conservation of Bajo Puinahua, or AIDECOBAP, is manning a river blockade that saw tankers seized en route to or leaving the Bretana heavy oilfield in Block 95 onshore Peru. The field, operated by Canadian oil producer PetroTal, has suffered frequent disruptions by indigenous protestors. This is not only due to river blockades but also because of roadblocks, oilfield invasions and the seizure of pumphouses for the Northern Peruvian oil pipeline or ONP. Those events continue to have a marked impact on Peru’s oil industry and production because Bretana is the country’s most productive oil field. Frequent oil spills in Peru’s Amazon, which according to local communities, are not effectively cleaned up, and a lack of investment by the central government in remote regions where the oil industry operates are driving the constant strife.   Related: India’s Oil Demand Set For Record High Despite Dipping In April These events act as a considerable deterrent to urgently needed foreign energy investment in Peru, which is required to expand petroleum production and reserves. President Dina Boluarte, who took office after President Pedro Castillo’s 2022 impeachment, issued a call for investment in Peru’s oil industry, offering 31 blocks for exploration and eased participation conditions in an attempt to drum up interest. This forms part of a long-running effort to reactivate oil blocks that had fallen dormant after being abandoned by their operators because of the ongoing difficulties associated with operating in Peru. Chile, with a 2022 GDP of $300 billion, is South America’s fourth-largest economy, with it being a country not normally associated with oil production. Copper mining is the Andean country’s primary economic driver, with red metal generating more than 55% of export income and 11% of GDP. Chile is fast emerging as a key global lithium producer, responsible for 30% of all of the metal’s production during 2022. For these reasons, Chile is a crucial participant in the energy transition, with copper and lithium being crucial materials for the clean energy transition. Chile does have a minor oil industry with an estimated 150 million barrels of proven oil reserves. The Andean country pumped an average of 1,750 barrels per day during February 2023, which is significantly lower than any of South America’s key oil-producing nations. The Vaca Muerta shale formation in neighboring Argentina is set to become an important source of energy for Chile which, as a minor hydrocarbon producer, is heavily dependent on energy imports. In May 2023, Chile’s national oil company ENAP signed an agreement with Argentina’s state-controlled YPF to import oil through the Transandino pipeline, which connects the Vaca Muerta to Chile’s port of Concepción. The crisis-riven country of Colombia is South America’s third-largest economy reporting a GDP of $344 billion. While the Andean country experienced strong economic growth after being sharply impacted by the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, with GDP expanding by a stunning 11% during 2021 and then a notable 7.5% for 2022, it has not yet fully recovered. Colombia’s oil industry has long been punching above its weight, with the country being South America’s second-largest petroleum producer behind Brazil and ahead of Venezuela. During 2013 Colombia, for the first time in its history, was lifting a record one million barrels of oil per day despite only possessing meager proven reserves of 2.4 billion barrels, well below those of nearby Venezuela, Ecuador and Brazil. Since then, production has been locked in a steady decline, starting with the late-2014 oil price collapse and then the 2020 pandemic when prices, for a brief moment, plunged into negative territory.  Colombia’s economically crucial industry has not returned to a pre-pandemic tempo of operations. While April 2023 production of 782,277 was the highest since December 2022 and 30,955 barrels per day more than for the same month a year earlier, it was still 12% lower than the 891,011 barrels per day lifted during April 2019. Industry investment is also falling, with the Colombian Petroleum Association expecting private-sector oil spending to fall by a third compared to a year earlier as tax hikes and plans to ban hydrocarbon exploration spark trepidation. Indeed, Colombia’s oil industry is facing a crisis with a multitude of grave geopolitical headwinds challenging its very survival. A dire lack of exploration success with no world-class oil discoveries since the 1990s leaves the Andean country with scant proven reserves of around 2 billion barrels which are enough to support another 7.5 years of production. The risks this poses to Colombia’s petroleum-dependent economy, where oil is the single largest export responsible, is magnified by the country’s first leftist President Gustavo Petro’s plans to ban oil exploration and fracking. Argentina, which was once one of the wealthiest countries in the world, with a 2022 GDP of $632 billion, is South America’s second-largest economy. The country for decades, has been embroiled in a series of economic crises that forced it to default nine times on its sovereign debt since its independence from Spain. As yet another economic crisis engulfs Argentina, inflation has spiraled into triple digits and is expected to end 2023 at over 150%. For more than a decade, Argentina’s central government in Buenos Aires has viewed the Vaca Muerta shale formation, which has been compared to the U.S. Permian shale, as a silver bullet for the country’s economic woes. The 7.5-million-acre geological formation is believed to contain 16 billion barrels of shale oil and 308 trillion cubic feet of shale gas resources.  The development of the Vaca Muerta, where national oil company YPF will spend $2.3 billion during 2023, is responsible for soaring petroleum and natural gas production in Argentina. For March 2023, petroleum production hit an all-time high of 631,103 barrels per day, which was 45% weighted to shale oil. It is the strong growth of shale oil and gas which is driving hydrocarbon output ever higher. There is every possibility that Argentina will become a leading regional producer as well as an exporter of oil and natural gas. Brazil with 2022 GDP of $1.92 trillion is South America’s largest economy. The country is also the continent’s largest oil producer pumping 3.1 million barrels of oil per day during April 2023. After Venezuela, Brazil possesses South America’s largest oil reserves totaling 14.9 billion barrels of proven or 1P reserves and 21.9 billion barrels of 2P reserves.ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Brazil’s energy ministry is committed to attracting further investment and increasing the efficiency of oil industry operations with a view to the country becoming the world’s fourth largest oil producer. This will require significant investment not only from national oil company Petrobras, which from 2023 to 2027 is committed to spending nearly $65 billion on exploration and production activities but also from foreign energy majors. Global supermajors such as Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies have greenlighted a series of oil and gas developments as well as infrastructure projects in offshore Brazil since the start of 2023. While lifting Brazil’s oil production to the targeted 5.4 million barrels per day from 3.1 million barrels daily will be a challenge, it does appear achievable despite the fears of increased government intervention from the leftist Lula administration. That will deliver a tremendous economic windfall for South America’s largest economy which has become dependent on the considerable revenue generated by the pre-salt offshore oil boom.",NeutralWill Chinas Rumored Economic Stimulus Boost Oil Prices.html,"The vast disparity between China’s oil needs to power its economy and its lack of oil reserves has meant that its economy has been a key driver for oil prices since the mid-1990s. This was when China’s then-leader Deng Xiaoping spearheaded a broad reforming agenda across the country’s economy that almost single-handedly created and sustained the commodities ‘supercycle’, as analysed in depth in my new book on the new global oil market order. China’s economic growth-led energy needs resulted in its becoming the world’s largest net importer of total petroleum and other liquid fuels in 2013. And, as late as 2017, China’s high rate of economic growth allowed it to overtake the U.S. as the largest annual gross crude oil importer in the world. As of now, China accounts for around 15-20 percent of total global oil demand. A slew of recent data releases has raised questions in the oil markets over the fragility of China’s economic recovery and the rumours are that new fiscal measures are to be taken to boost its recovery. Whether these will work is the big question for oil prices and is answered below.  Last week saw another set of disappointing economic figures from China. Industrial production increased by 3.5 percent year on year in May, down from a 5.6 percent rise in April and less than market forecasts of 3.6 percent. Highlighting the mixed messaging from China’s recent economic data, this was the 13th straight month of growth in industrial output, but it was at the slowest rate seen in three months. The same pattern was seen in last week’s retail sales figure, which increased by 12.7 percent year on year in May from the previous year. Although it was the fourth straight monthly increase, it was down from an 18.4 percent rise in the previous month and was below market forecasts of 13.6 percent. In the same vein was last week’s release of figures showing that China’s fixed-asset investment grew by 4.0 percent year on year to CNY18.88 trillion (US$2.65 trillion) in the first five months of 2023, less than market forecasts of 4.4 percent and down from a 4.7 percent rise in the previous period. Completing a quad of similar results, China’s urban unemployment rate remained unchanged in May at 5.2 percent.  Related: Saudi Arabia’s Crude Oil Exports Dropped To A Five-Month Low In April In broad terms, as also analysed in depth in my new book on the new global oil market order, a key part of the reason for this reduction in economic growth indicators is the lingering effects of China’s long-running battle with COVID-19. Another key part is the shift in its economic growth model in recent years. From 1992 to 1998, China’s annual economic growth rate was basically between 10 to 15 percent; from 1998 to 2004 between 8 to 10 percent; from 2004 to 2010 between 10 to 15 percent again; from 2010 to 2016 between 6 to 10 percent, and from 2016 to 2022 between 5 to 7 percent. For much of the period from 1992 to the middle 2010s, much of China’s massive economic growth was founded on a huge energy-intensive expansion of its manufacturing capabilities. This also involved the mass migration of new workers from the countryside and into the cities, which required a huge energy-intensive infrastructure build-out. Even after some of China’s growth began to switch into the less energy-intensive service sectors, the country’s investment in energy-intensive infrastructure build-out remained very high. This pattern continued for many years, alongside the third phase of China’s economic growth, which was the rise of a middle class that powered domestic consumption-led demand for goods and services. All these phases had the net result of increasing China’s demand for energy exponentially. However, since the decline of COVID-19 that in China occurred only very recently, the country is in a new phase of economic growth entirely. This is reliant on just reopening the economy post-COVID and removing negative policies - property, consumer, and geopolitics - rather than on aggressive stimulus, to drive activity. “For the first time, a cyclical recovery in China will be led by household consumption, mainly services, as there is a great deal of pent-up demand and savings - about four percent of GDP - following three years of intermittent mobility restrictions,” Rory Green, chief China economist for TS Lombard, in London, exclusively told OilPrice.com.  Given this backdrop, rumours have abounded about possible measures that China may take to provide a further boost to its economy. One focus has been on the property market, which remains in a troubling state. Property price inflation remains in negative territory, although prices have continued to post monthly improvements, with 64 out of 70 cities now reporting monthly price gains, TS Lombard’s Green exclusively told OilPrice.com. This was seen again in recent figures showing that new home prices in 70 major cities dropped by 0.2 percent year on year in April, much slower than the 0.8 percent fall in the previous month. This was the 12th straight month of decrease in new home prices, but the softest rate seen since May 2022. There has been market talk of a huge stimulus package aimed in part at redressing this situation – similar to those after the Great Financial Crisis – but this seems highly unlikely. “It will be more of the same: a lowering of mortgage rates and the lifting of some deposit requirements and home-purchase restrictions,” said Green last week. “Markets are likely to be disappointed by stimulus announcements and their impact on the real economy,” he added.  Another focus has been on tackling the structural and cyclical dislocation driving youth unemployment, but worse may still be to come in this context. “Employment and wage growth are of particular concern for Beijing, and they have a higher weighting in policymakers’ reaction function than this year’s ‘about 5 percent’ GDP target,” he underlined. The caution that China appears to be taking on fiscal measures elsewhere, including in the property sector, might not be adhered to in terms of creating the 12 million new jobs targeted. “Concerns about employment have been clearly evident in official statements in recent weeks, although thus far, the official diagnosis is the combination of ‘skills mismatch’ and unwillingness to undertake primary- or secondary-industry work,” Green told OilPrice.com last week.  “The Communist Youth League has said that students should ‘take off their suits, roll up their sleeves and go to the farmland’, while President Xi has commented that new graduates will have to ‘eat bitterness’, an adage connoting the stoic acceptance of hardship,” he added. “We agree to some extent with the skills mismatch theory but think the bigger issue is economy-wide confidence and a lack of aggregate demand,” he underlined. In recent weeks, both the State Council and leading Party organs have started to address the unemployment issue with the launch of several small-scale policy efforts particularly targeted at reducing youth joblessness. This said, up to now, there had been no signs of urgency to alter the headline stimulus stance. “It is only now that signals of greater concern among policymakers are starting to emerge, notably last week with deposit rate cuts at China’s largest banks,” highlighted Green. “And with the coming graduation of approximately 12 million students over the next few weeks and continued softness in non-services indicators, we think Beijing will shift to a more dovish position after the July Politburo meeting,” he added. Specifically, he said, a further acceleration of local government-bond issuance and infrastructure spending can be expected in this regard, as well as increases in consumption vouchers and a small reduction in various employers’ social security contributions. “On the monetary side, a 10-basis points cut to the loan prime rate and a 25-basis points reduction to the required reserve ration are likely in Q3/23,” he underlined. This said, all these measures fall within the operational parameters of China’s new economic phase, as outlined above. For oil prices, it is apposite to note that transportation, as a prime example, accounts for just 54 percent of China’s oil consumption, compared to 72 percent in the U.S. and 68 percent in the European Union. In 2022, net oil and refined petroleum imports were eight percent lower by volume than the pre-COVID-19 peak, with infrastructure and export-oriented manufacturing partly offsetting lower mobility and less property construction. “Demand drivers should switch this year, with travel rising and property less negative, while infrastructure and manufacturing slow,” said Green. “The certain outcome is an increase in oil demand - we estimate a five to eight percent increase in net import volumes – but this is unlikely to cause oil prices to surge,” he highlighted. “This is especially as China is buying at a discount from Russia,” he concluded.",PosNew Mexico Is Driving Permian Oil Production Growth.html,"The top-producing U.S. oil basin, the Permian, is setting records in production, although growth has slowed in recent months as the number of drilling rigs drops.   The New Mexico part of the biggest U.S. shale play has seen larger growth than Texas in recent years, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) has shown.   Large producers with a lot of inventory, including Chevron, can shift their Permian drilling programs to more single bench, high-return developments in New Mexico, the U.S. supermajor said earlier this year.  New Mexico’s Growth Accounts For 50% of Crude Output Increase New Mexico saw the highest crude oil production growth of any U.S. state last year, with output gains of 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) accounting for half of America’s oil production increase, the EIA said in a report last month.  Total U.S. crude oil production increased by 600,000 bpd in 2022 compared with 2021, averaging 11.9 million bpd, per EIA’s Monthly Crude Oil and Natural Gas Production report. For the third year in a row, New Mexico’s oil production growth eclipsed the growth of crude output in any other U.S. state, including Texas, the biggest U.S. oil-producing state and also home to part of the Permian shale basin.  Crude oil production in New Mexico jumped by 300,000 bpd to 1.6 million bpd in 2022, a record for the state, the EIA has estimated. New Mexico and Texas contributed the most growth to U.S. crude oil production in 2022, while oil output in the rest of the United States grew by just 0.6% last year, or by 33,000 bpd.

New Mexico accounted for more than 13% of total U.S. crude oil production according to EIA data.  Supermajors Keep High Permian Output Targets  The U.S. supermajors plan to significantly grow their oil and gas production in the Permian basin, and have recently reiterated their ambitious output targets.   “We're now forecasting that our Permian production will reach about 1 million barrels a day by 2027,” Exxon CEO Darren Woods said on the Q4 2022 earnings call at the end of January 2023. “If you think about ultimately getting to 1 million barrels a day by 2027, that's roughly a 13% compounded annual growth rate. That's not going to be steady every year. That will kind of fluctuate, call it, plus or minus 5%,” Woods noted.  Chevron also targets a million barrels of oil equivalent production in the Permian, by 2025.  “With our large inventory, we’re able to shift our operated program to more single bench, high-return developments in New Mexico. Our guidance remains to achieve one million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2025,” Nigel Hearne, Chevron’s EVP of Oil, Products & Gas, said on the company’s Investor Day in February.  U.S. Shale Output Growth Slowing  However, signs are emerging that growth in the U.S. shale patch, including in the Permian, is slowing.  The biggest U.S. shale regions are expected to produce a record-high level of crude oil in July, but growth is sputtering and set to be the slowest since December 2022, data from the EIA’s Drilling Productivity Report showed earlier this week.  The seven main shale-producing regions in the United States are expected to pump 9.375 million bpd of crude oil next month, a record high, but growth would be only 8,000 bpd higher than the estimated June crude oil production of 9.367 million bpd, the report showed.  The Permian, the top-producing region, is set to see only a 1,000-bpd increase in output, although July production is expected at a record 5.763 million bpd. The rise in output would be the smallest in the Permian since February 2023. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Oil production increases are slowing as the new priorities of the shale patch – capital discipline and a focus on returns to shareholders and debt repayments – have coupled with supply chain constraints and cost inflation to weigh on growth in recent months.  Higher costs are constraining production growth and eating into margins despite the fact that oil prices haven't moved lower than $70 per barrel for an extended period of time over the past year and a half.   “That squeeze in the margin is really keeping U.S. E&Ps (exploration and production companies) from moving forward in a significant way” despite OPEC's efforts to push up prices, Pioneer Natural Resources Vice President Beth McDonald told Reuters at RBN Energy's crude export conference in Houston last week. In addition, shale investors want more returns and a limit on spending, McDonald added.  “In general, you'll still see those modest growth rates and those low reinvestment rates because we continue to focus on returning cash to shareholders,” one of Pioneer’s top executives added.  Even at a slower pace, the Permian has several more years of production growth, analysts say, and a large part of that growth would likely come from top drilling locations in New Mexico.",NegChina Is Quickly Becoming The Worlds Largest Refiner.html,"In its new medium-term report on oil that came out last week, the International Energy Agency predicted that oil demand will peak by 2028. This is not the first time the IEA is predicting peak oil and the reason is also the same as the reason for previous predictions to this tune: a surge in EV adoption that would displace demand for fuels. Yet the new IEA report also mentioned something else that would probably make politicians in Europe and North America who want to ban internal combustion engines quite happy. What the report mentioned was that China is on its way to becoming the country with the greatest oil refining capacity in the world. And this would make it the single biggest supplier of things like gasoline and diesel to the world. With the power to dictate prices. This is what Reuters columnist Clyde Russell noted this in a column dedicated to this part of the IEA report. “China's refined product exports are subject to quotas granted by Beijing, which acts more in what it deems the interests of the domestic economy and markets, rather than what the global markets may be signalling,” Russell wrote. The IEA itself also recognised China’s growing role as fuel supplier to the world by pointing out that “Crucially, our forecast for product balances is heavily dependent on higher Chinese product exports, especially for diesel.”  Related: Mexican State Firm Was The Top Net Buyer Of U.S. Natural Gas In 2022 China overtook the United States to become the world’s largest refiner last year, the IEA also noted in its report, but it is not stopping there. Instead, refiners in China are building even more capacity, with the total set to reach 19.7 million barrels daily by 2028. Of this, more than 3 million barrels daily will be spare capacity, the IEA said. The presence of this spare capacity suggests that China may be planning to really become the world’s fuel supplier after European and U.S. refiners shut down their facilities under the weight of ICE phase-out mandates or convert them to biofuel production plants. Because China knows that you can’t ban ICE cars and switch entirely to EVs. China is not only the world’s biggest refiner of oil. The country is also the biggest market for electric vehicles in the world. The IEA forecast that by 2028, there will be more than 155 million EVs sold in total globally. More than half of these cars, the report added, will be sold in China. Already, China accounts for more than half of global EV sales. Yet at the same time it is building more oil refining capacity. On the face of it, this may look odd and possibly even irrational. It could indeed be a miscalculation and China could end up with several million barrels in unused and unusable oil refining capacity as demand for fuels slumps. On the other hand, it might be the same thing that China is doing with wind, solar, and coal. One of the other things that the country is the biggest in is wind and solar generation capacity. At the same time, it is also the most active builder of new coal plants, too. Because, as stated by government officials, China is all in on all energy and is not picking favourites. China is going to become the world’s refiner. The size of its exports will depend on what the ruling party decides should be exported. And this means that China will have its hand on the global fuel price lever the way OPEC has its hand on the crude oil price lever.ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Those ICE bans in the EU, Britain, and California might end up being a necessity rather than a transition-happy whim. And even then, there will be no escape from dependence on China: the biggest producer and processor of battery minerals in the world.",NegChina Bets On Ultra Deepwater Oil And Gas.html,"The China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), the government-owned parent company of  PetroChina, and Cnooc (OTCPK: CEOHF) has kicked off ultra-deepwater exploratory drilling for oil and gas as the country looks to wean itself of foreign oil.  According to Chinese news agency Xinhua Global Service, CNPC will drill a test borehole of up to 11,000 meters (36,089 feet), the country’s deepest ever, which will help it better understand the Earth’s internal structure better, as well as to test underground drilling techniques. CNPC’s borehole depth is not far from Qatar’s world record of 12,289 meters (40,318 feet) for a petroleum well depth that was drilled in the Al Shaheen Oil Field in 2008 or Russia’s Kola Superdeep well that reached a depth of 12,262 meters (40,230 feet). In the oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) industry, deepwater is defined as water depth greater than 1,000 feet while ultra-deepwater is defined as depths greater than 5,000 feet.  Deepwater Boom But China is not the only country willing to drill to ridiculous depths in the pursuit of energy security. Deepwater oil and gas production is set to increase by 60% by 2030, to contribute 8% of overall upstream production, according to a new report from Wood Mackenzie, as cited by Rig Zone.  Ultra-deepwater production is set to continue growing at breakneck speed to account for half of all deepwater production by 2030. Deepwater production remains the fastest-growing upstream oil and gas segment with production expected to hit 10.4 million boe/d in 2022 from just 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) in 1990. Wood Mackenzie has predicted that by the end of the decade, that figure will pass 17 million boe/d. Norway's Aker BP (NYSE:BP) (OTCQX:AKRBF) is the latest oil major to make an ultra-deepwater discovery. At a total depth of 8,168 m, Aker BP says the well is the longest exploration well drilled in offshore Norway. The much bigger than expected oil discovery was made in the Yggdrasil area of the North Sea.  Related: Kurdistan Has Lost $2 Billion Due To Its Oil Exports Saga Preliminary estimates indicate a gross recoverable volume of 40 million-90 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe), much higher than the company’s earlier projection of between 18 million and 45 million boe.

The plan for development and operations (PDO) for this project was submitted to Norwegian authorities in December 2022, with production scheduled to start in 2027. In 2021, U.S. oil and gas major Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) made a big deepwater oil and gas find. Exxon announced that it had made two more discoveries at the Sailfin-1 and Yarrow-1 wells in the Stabroek block offshore Guyana, bringing discoveries on the block to more than 30 since 2015.  Exxon revealed that the Sailfin-1 well was drilled in 4,616 feet of water and encountered 312 feet of hydrocarbon-bearing sandstone, while the Yarrow-1 well was drilled in 3,560 feet of water and encountered 75 feet of hydrocarbon-bearing sandstone. Exxon did not disclose how much crude oil or gas it estimates the new discoveries to contain, but hiked a previous output forecast for the third quarter from older discoveries in the region.  The supermajor has boosted development and production offshore Guyana at a pace that ""far exceeds the industry average”. Exxon’s two sanctioned offshore Guyana projects, Liza Phase 1 and Liza Phase 2, are now producing above design capacity and have already achieved an average of nearly 360K bbl/day of oil. The supermajor expects total production from Guyana to cross a million barrels per day by the end of this decade.ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Exxon said a third project, Payara, is expected to launch by year-end 2023 while a fourth project, Yellowtail, could kick off operations in 2025.  Exxon is the operator of the Stabroek block where it holds a 45% interest while partners Hess Corp. (NYSE: HES) and Cnooc hold a 30% and 25% interest, respectively.

In fuels, inventory changes were also positive the week to June 9. In gasoline, the EIA estimated an inventory increase of 2.1 million barrels for the period, with production averaging 10.2 million barrels daily. This compared with an inventory build of 2.7 million barrels for the previous week, when production stood at an average of 10.1 million barrels daily.

Shell, which was sued into cutting its oil output, is going back to oil and gas in a big way, and talking openly about its bottom-line change of heart.  Several days ago, Reuters reported that Shell was going to scrap its oil output reduction plans. Not only had it already hit its reduction targets through asset sales, the report said, but it was enjoying the returns its oil business was making. Citing unnamed sources close to the company, Reuters reported that the new chief executive of the company, Wael Sawan, was this week going to announce a cancellation of an annual oil output reduction target of between 1 and 2%. Some expect him to also announce plans for more spending on oil and gas, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Sawan, who took office early this year, had said earlier that the transition should not advance at the expense of oil and gas profits. In fact, it has become pretty obvious that the transition cannot advance at all without oil and gas used to power the equipment used to mine critical minerals and metals, process them around the world, and produce the panels, turbines, and infrastructure necessary for a shift to low-carbon energy. Yet the transition has failed to live to the promise Big Oil executives assumed was a safe one. First BP and now Shell are either downsizing—BP—or scrapping some of their wind, solar, hydrogen and biofuels—Shell—plans. Because they are not making the returns that were expected of them. But oil and gas are making more than probably expected. Gas appears to be particularly attractive, according to a recent Bloomberg report. Citing more unnamed sources, Shell has been urging its LNG teams to boost business in India and China, motivating them with the promise of higher bonuses for successful deals in both these and also other countries. “We have always known that gas is crucial for the energy transition, but our new strategy is built around a new belief — that gas will continue to play a key role in the energy mix,” Shell executive VP for LNG told Bloomberg. This is quite a departure from the mostly deafening silence coming from European Big Oil majors in the past couple of years as activist pressure doubled and tripled, prompting them to start talking about emission reduction plans, tracking and recording, and output cuts. Apparently, judging by how activists’ climate resolutions fared at this year’s AGMs of the European supermajors, most shareholders did not want Shell, BP, and TotalEnergies to focus on emissions and output reduction. They wanted them to focus on returns—and if these returns are fatter from the core oil and gas business then that must be expanded. On Wednesday, CEO Wael Sawan will present the new strategy of Shell at the New York Stock Exchange. Per the WSJ, there are expectations that he will announce a return to a focus on oil and gas production on the grounds that the transition will leave whole nations behind unless the world goes easy on the reduction of oil and gas consumption. If the presentation indeed does that, chances are it will get activists angry—angry enough to sue again, perhaps. This makes Sawan’s defense of Shell’s core business all the more meaningful: it is a reality check that was long overdue, not only for Shell but for all the European supermajors. It’s oil and gas that makes the money, not wind and hydrogen.ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT",NegUS Shale Still Not Convinced To Invest More In Growth.html,"Earlier this month, a senior executive from Pioneer Natural Resources predicted higher oil prices later this year. Demand for crude was rising strongly, executive VP Beth McDonald told Reuters last week, but supply was playing catch-up and without much enthusiasm. That there is a new normal in U.S. shale—the part of the oil industry that turned the country into the largest producer of the commodity—has been clear for a while now. Even with prices above $100 last year, U.S. shale drillers went about production growth cautiously. They continued to go about it cautiously even when the federal government pleaded with them to boost output. But was this caution the result of a deliberate decision or was it forced by factors outside the control of the industry? NPR recently published an overview of the new normal in U.S. oil, which noted external factors such as inflation and workforce shortages as hurdles for U.S. shale oil growth. However, the top factor for the change in business behavior in the industry, according to author Camila Domonoske, was investor pressure on management to slow down. This is by no means a fringe opinion. In fact, it seems to be the dominant one when it comes to U.S. shale and the changes that the industry has been undergoing in the past couple of years. Basically, it has moved from the classic boom-bust cycle to a quieter line of development, under pressure from shareholders who’d had enough of watching their money get poured into more barrels that only brought the price of oil—and dividends—lower. Yet, there are plenty of U.S. shale oil companies that are not public entities. They do not have shareholders. And yet they seem to be going about production just as cautiously as public companies, judging by the trend in drilling rigs. Even though breakeven prices, at least in the Permian, are considerably lower than what WTI is trading at right now, there is no surge in drilling. And this means that investor pressure on its own is not enough of an explanation for the current state of U.S. shale. In fact, it may be the external factors that have gained the upper hand.  Related: Deadly Cyclone In India Halts Fuel Exports And Operations At Offshore Rigs Energy industry veteran David Blackmon put forward that argument in a recent article for Forbes. In it, Blackmon pointed out that inflation has a big role to play in production growth decisions, as does disappointment with the pace of China’s economic recovery and Saudi Arabia’s decision to reduce production by 1 million bpd. Inflation has plagued all industries since the end of lockdowns, along with its pal, labor shortage. That has motivated employers to offer higher wages to workers, which, in turn, has served to fuel overall cost inflation and discourage production expansion further. Bloomberg reported that hourly wages for U.S. oil workers have climbed to $43 per hour: a record high. But these workers are not boosting output. They are maintaining it. China appears to have been the big disappointment for executives that may have had just a little bit too much faith in growth projections. Despite record oil demand and surging oil imports, there seems to be a skepticism about China’s oil demand dynamics based on monthly economic indicators. And, as Blackmon notes, this will inform investment decisions in U.S. shale over the second half of the year. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has squeezed OPEC+ supply with its voluntary cut. This means there will be less oil coming from the cartel in the second half of the year. And the Federal government just bought 3 million barrels of crude as a start to the refilling of the strategic petroleum reserve. Even so, supply is unlikely to reverse the current trend in U.S. shale. Inflation remains a top concern and so does China. ""That squeeze in the margin is really keeping U.S. E&Ps from moving forward in a significant way,"" Pioneer’s McDonald told Reuters. ""In general, you'll still see those modest (production) growth rates and those low reinvestment rates because we continue to focus on returning cash to shareholders."" Those shareholders have no doubt heard the latest from China, which is a further deceleration in factory activity and lower exports, which prompted Goldman Sachs to revise down its oil price forecast for the third time this year. And this means the pressure will remain, to complement inflation. Indeed, there is a new normal in U.S. shale and this new normal seems like it is here to stay. Even if China’s economic indicators begin to point to a stronger rebound; even if the Biden administration decides to fill the SPR inside a year and is ready to pay any price; even if OPEC+ cuts output further.ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT This is because oil executives have a longer horizon than the next six months. When they make plans, they look at the medium term, as Pioneer’s Scott Sheffield explained at the end of last year. Commenting on the federal government’s plan to start buying oil for the SPR with the claim that would put a floor under oil prices, Sheffield said, as quoted by the FT that “Putting a floor of $70 is no help for the producer. If they want to encourage additional activity, they will have to put a floor somewhere around $100 — especially with significant increases in service costs.” That’s one thing that is definitely not happening, not with this administration.",PosMixed Data Keeping Oil Markets On Edge.html,"Oil markets have become highly volatile in the current week as traders try to make sense of a mix of both bullish and bearish drivers. Oil prices rallied mid-week  after the latest EIA report showed crude refining has hit the highest level since August 2019 in anticipation of strong summer demand. However, the same report revealed that U.S. crude production has hit the highest levels since April 2020 while crude exports have declined. Indeed, commodity analysts at Standard Chartered have termed the report neutral, saying  Its proprietary U.S. oil data bull-bear index rose 34.1 w/w to +8.5 (Fig.  58).

The w/w crude oil balance shows unusually large swings in exports and imports. But the most bearish piece of news came outside the U.S. market with reports that Iran might soon officially resume oil exports.   Source: Standard Chartered Research Iran Wildcard U.S. crude fell  nearly 5% on Thursday to briefly trade below $70/bbl after reports emerged that the U.S. and Iran are making progress after resuming talks on a nuclear deal, a move that could ease sanctions on Iran's oil exports.  Israel's Haaretz newspaper has reported that the talks are moving forward more rapidly than expected, with the possibility of a deal being struck in a matter of weeks. Deal terms are likely to include Iran ceasing its 60% and higher uranium enrichment activities in return for permission to export as much as 1M bbl/day of oil.  Related: Pentagon Papers Show Saudi Arabia, U.S. Traded Threats Over Oil Prospects of reviving the Iran nuclear deal have swung dramatically, from near certain in March to almost nil by the end of 2022 and now this. Iran’s dire economic situation is likely to force its hand into eventually accepting monitoring and signing a new nuclear deal sooner rather than later, with the country’s foreign currency reserves having greatly dwindled from $122.5 billion in 2018 to a mere $20 billion in 2021 before recovering to $41.4 billion in 2022. With the rate of foreign currency-denominated capital flight out of Iran running at nearly $5billion per month, Iran is not in a very enviable situation.  A successful nuclear deal could change the oil markets, with former Iran oil minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh saying that his biggest dream has always been to increase Iran’s oil output to six million barrels per day; earn $2 trillion through oil exports over the next two decades and use the income to invest in the country’s development.  Such a level of production would definitely cause considerable jitters especially with OPEC ready to take the country back to its fold once the sanctions are lifted. But how realistic are Iran’s oil ambitions and how much do the oil bulls need to worry about another large producer potentially muddying the waters for everybody? Over the short-term, Iran rejoining the oil markets might not change anything much. After all, It’s an open secret that Tehran has been flouting U.S. sanctions by applying several cloaking methods to evade detection and sell its crude to China.  Things could be different though over the long-term.ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Iran’s current production of ~2.5M b/d is 1.2 million b/d less than the 2018 peak at 3.7 mb/d. Boosting production from the current 2.5mb/d to 6mb/d could take several years at the very least. And even then it would be far from a certainty. Over the past four decades, Tehran has miserably failed to adequately re-invest its oil income into its production capacity or diversify its economy. In fact, since the 1979 revolution, the Islamic Republic has never at any point in time been able to produce more than 4 million bpd. To complicate matters further, foreign investors have mostly stayed away from Iran’s economy in the four decades since the Islamic Republic was established. In sharp contrast, foreign investments--mostly oil-related-- in its Arabian peers including Saudi Arabia totaled more than $170 billion from 2006-2012, and have continued to grow at an annual clip of 10 billion dollars since.  Part of the problem here is that the state-controlled economic model wastes more than $50 billion a year on oil and gas subsidies to keep its citizens docile. The result is that Iranians enjoy the cheapest gasoline and electricity prices of anywhere on the globe, but have to contend with high unemployment and inflation due to an economy that relies too heavily on petrodollars. There’s little reason to believe that Raisi’s administration will do much to reform the economic model given the latest spate of populist promises of even more subsidies.",NeutralPioneer Sees 70 100 Oil As Supply Growth Remains Constrained.html,"Oil prices are set to rise later this year and trade in the $70-$100 range over the next three to five years as supply growth remains limited and OPEC+ continues to restrict output, according to a top executive at the largest pure-play U.S. shale producer, Pioneer Natural Resources.

Shale executives, however, are not so optimistic, and some believe peak Permian oil production is five or six years away as drillers exhaust the prime acreage.  American oil executives already said in early March that OPEC is once again the most influential force in global oil supply – and will be so for the foreseeable future – now that U.S. shale production growth is slowing.  Pioneer's chief executive Scott Sheffield told the Financial Times earlier this year, ""I think the people that are in charge now are three countries — and they'll be in charge the next 25 years."" ""Saudi first, UAE second, Kuwait third."" Meanwhile, peak Permian oil production is just five or six years away, according to Sheffield, who attributed this forecast from March to expectations that drillers will have exhausted by then the prime drilling acreage in the top shale-producing basin.   Permian production could peak around 2030, Danny Wesson, Diamondback Energy's executive vice president and chief operating officer, said at Hart Energy's Super DUG event last month.  ""[By] the end of the decade… plus or minus a couple of years, you might see the Permian peak and start plateauing,"" Wesson said.  ""The longer it takes us to get there, the longer it will plateau and run flat. But the faster we get there, it will decline faster,"" Diamondback's senor executive added.  ""I think end of decade is a good time to think about [flat or declining production], but you can't count the Permian out."" The most recent Dallas Fed Energy Survey for Q1 showed at the end of March that oil and gas expansion in Texas, New Mexico, and Louisiana – home to the biggest shale plays, including the Permian – stalled amid surging costs and worsening outlooks. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT In comments to the survey, one U.S. executive at an E&P firm noted, ""The Energy Information Administration put out its Annual Energy Outlook this week, and it forecasts that oil production from the U.S. will be flat for the next 30 years. We should probably inform them of the collapse in shale production we are going to see in under five years.""  Another executive said,  ""The administration's policies will continue to affect domestic natural gas and oil production negatively. Oil and gas prices will soar in the next few years, and we'll be at the mercy of nations that hate us.""",PosWill Trudeaus Plan To Clean Up Canadas Oil Sands Work.html,"Canada has long relied on its oil sands to support its energy security and bring in revenue for the major oil-producing province of Alberta. Oil sands are known as one of the most polluting forms of crude, meaning the Canadian government has faced repeated calls to cut production to support the country’s climate aims and reduce its impact on the environment. However, Alberta has lobbied hard to ensure production continues, and with the energy shortages faced in 2022, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has responded to international pleas to continue oil production. Now, Trudeau is aiming to massively reduce the carbon footprint of Canada’s oil sands through investment in carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, but many believe this is an insufficient response to polluting oil sands operations and highly contradictory to the country’s climate goals.  Oil sands continue to be one of the world’s most carbon-intensive, large-scale crude oil operations, producing around 31 percent more emissions than the average North-American crude from the point of extraction through its lifecycle to the point of end use, according to the Carnegie Endowment’s Oil-Climate Index. It is extremely energy intensive to extract and process oil sands barrels to achieve usable crude. Yet Alberta continues to rely heavily on its oil sands operations to support the province’s jobs and revenue, having produced this type of crude since the 1960s. Despite repeated calls to curb production, to prevent further damage to the environment, Alberta has been strong on its stance to keep producing, and so far, Trudeau has let this continue.  But this month, Trudeau announced plans to invest billions in public investment in the cleaning up of operations. He hopes to achieve this by installing CCS technologies into oil operations to help capture the carbon emitted during the production of the crude. Trudeau is trying to both support a major economic sector –while oil demand remains high, as well as achieve his ambitious climate targets, such as net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Prime Minister has pledged $12.4 billion in tax credits for building carbon capture systems to date, including a large-scale project to reduce oil sands carbon emissions by 10 million metric tonnes by 2030.  By 2050, investments in Canada’s CCS technology are expected to help reduce carbon emissions by around 40 million metric tonnes a year, helping to support the continuation of the oil sands industry, which contributed 7 percent of the country’s economy and over a fifth of goods exported. The plan for CCS in the oil sands industry is for it to sequester carbon dioxide from the upgrader facilities that transform mined bitumen into lighter crude. The equipment will also extract CO2 from steam generators at well sites. This carbon will then be injected underground at a depth of around 1,000 metres into an aquifer – the Basal Cambrian Sandstone formation. Construction is expected to begin in 2026 for operations to start before the end of the decade. However, many scientists are suggesting that the efficacy of CCS technologies is highly overstated.  CCS methods have existed for decades, but following greater pressure to support a green transition, many energy companies and industries have invested in the research and development of enhanced, large-scale CCS systems in recent years. Many companies, particularly those working in heavy industry, are relying heavily on CCS as a means of decarbonisation in sectors that are very difficult to decarbonise. However, there have been several challenges to rolling out CCS tech on a wider scale, largely due to geological limitations major technical faults and prohibitive costs, meaning that many systems underperform in practice.  Moreover, in April 2023, a new federal investigation showed that the greenhouse gas emissions from Alberta’soil sands operations could be much higher than originally estimated, showing the dire need for political action. Researchers used new methods to measure emissions from the oil sands, resulting in a figure around 65 percent higher than those reported by the industry. The lead author of the report, Sumi Wren, stated: “We found that (emissions) are higher than the CO2 estimates that are reported in the greenhouse gas reporting program.” According to the report, oil sands could be producing around 32 million more tonnes of carbon dioxide a year than is being reported, with underreporting dating back to at least 2018.  The CCS approach to Canadian oil seems to go against Trudeau’s liberal policy agenda and is extremely high risk. Not only is he unlikely to garner the favour of the conservative province of Alberta, but he could risk alienating his liberal following, many of whom are concerned about climate change. While there are high hopes for CCS technologies in hard-to-decarbonise industries, most agree that this is not a long-term solution to addressing the environmental impact of oil operations, particularly the most-polluting kind.",NeutralNorth Sea Oil Investment Needs More Than Just Windfall Tax Relief.html,"The government needs to do more than ease the windfall tax to reassure troubled North Sea oil and gas companies over the UK’s investment climate and protect future production, warned Offshore Energies UK (OEUK). The industry body’s chief executive David Whitehouse welcomed the Treasury’s decision to introduce a price floor into the Energy Profits Levy, and said it was only fair that “when the windfall conditions go, the windfall tax should go.” However, he believed this had to be the starting point for improving investment conditions in the North Sea rather than a conclusive policy. “This is a step in the right direction, but many more will need to be taken to restore confidence to our sector. We will now work closely with government and lenders to understand the detail of the measure and its effectiveness at unlocking investment,” he said. This follows the Treasury unveiling the Energy Security Investment Mechanism (ESIM) earlier today, which establishes a price floor at $71.40 per barrel and 54p per therm. At this point, the Energy Profits Levy – known as the windfall tax – would fall away entirely, with taxes on earnings dropping from 75 to 40 per cent. However, oil prices would need to fall below the price floor for a period of six months for the windfall tax to be removed. Based on forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibly, ESIM will not be triggered before the tax’s planned end date in March 2028. City A.M. first revealed the industry was pushing for a price floor earlier this year, which was being considered by the Treasury ahead of ‘Green Day’ – the government response to the US Inflation Reduction Act which turned out to be highly underwhelming. ESIM is designed to bolster certainty in the oil and gas sector to raise capital, following fossil fuel producers including Total, Enquest and Harbour Energy withdrawing from key projects this year. Meanwhile, Rosebank – the largest undeveloped oil and gas field in the North Sea – faces an uncertain future with minority stakeholder Ithaca Energy weighing up whether to invest in the project. It has been locked in talks with the government over the project for months, as exclusively covered by City A.M. North Sea oil and gas exploration is featured in the government’s energy security strategy – as it looks to reduce its reliance overseas supplies. However, today’s announcement has been panned within the industry, with criticisms aimed at the price floor’s low oil price and forecast lack of usage. This meant they feared it would fail to encourage more investment in the North Sea.ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT An industry source told City A.M. that the ESIM “doesn’t do anything” to change investment conditions and will not encourage banks – which have toughened lending rules – to provide more capital to oil and gas companies. They dismissed the floor threshold as below conventional conditions – with six month periods of oil prices that low typically representing only severe economic conditions.",NeutralOil Moves Up Despite Rising Product Inventories.html,"Crude oil prices inched higher today after the Energy Information Administration reported an inventory decline of 500,000 barrels for the week to June 9. This compared with an inventory build of 4.5 million barrels for the previous week, which pushed prices lower. At 459.2 million barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories are around 2% below the five-year average for this time of the year, the EIA said. In fuels, the agency estimated inventory builds across the board. Gasoline stocks added 2.7 million barrels in the reporting period, which compared with a draw of 200,000 barrels for the previous week. Gasoline production averaged 10.1 million barrels daily, compared with 10 million bpd a week earlier. Middle distillate inventories went up by 5.1 million barrels in the week to June 9, which compared with a build of 1 million barrels for the previous week. Middle distillate production averaged 5.2 million bpd, which compared with 5 million barrels daily a week earlier. Oil prices, meanwhile, extended their slide that began on Monday after a quick jump following the latest OPEC+ production cut announcement. Later in the day, they reversed the decline. At the time of writing, Brent crude was trading at $77.10 per barrel and West Texas Intermediate was changing hands at $72.58 per barrel, both up from opening by more than a percentage point. The stubborn slide in prices from earlier this week was the result of downward pressure coming from mounting concern among traders about global economic growth. However, today it seems the news of the additional Saudi cuts began to sink in, pushing prices higher. ""The fears of recession, as more and more sombre economic readings point towards a slowdown, have kept a lid on oil prices, eroding all OPEC+'s efforts to keep prices afloat,"" a Philip Nova analyst said in a note as quoted by Reuters. Earlier this week, the Institute for Supply Management reported that the U.S. service sector had contracted to 50.3 in May from a reading of 51.9 for April.ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT The manufacturing sector has been shrinking for seven months. New orders for manufacturing sector have risen but only in the defense industry, Reuters noted in a report Tuesday.",PosVenezuelas Secret Weapon A Dark Fleet Of Oil Tankers.html,"Dark fleet is a term used to describe the assortment of tanker vessels which conceal their locations so as to enable the transportation of illicit cargoes of crude oil and derivative products. This is done using a variety of deceptive techniques to prevent the tanker from being identified or tracked. These include turning off the vessel’s ID system, spoofing its location and using multiple flags of convenience over short periods. While this has been a long-running practice that emerged to cloak the transportation and sale of U.S.-sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iraq it exploded after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. To penalize Moscow for the attack on Ukraine, the U.S. and its allies sanctioned Russia’s economically crucial petroleum exports. This caused the volume of vessels evading identification to surge. A substantially larger dark fleet is extremely beneficial for Nicolas Maduro’s Venezuela, which only two years ago was a near-failed state on the verge of collapse but has since seen its economy return to growth. The dark fleet first emerged as U.S. sanctions against Iran and Venezuela were ratcheted up to prevent those pariah states from exporting their crude oil to key markets without incurring hefty penalties. The volume of tankers clandestinely shipping petroleum to Iran and Venezuela has surged over the last three years. According to a Reuters investigation, there was a fleet of 300 vessels clandestinely shipping Iranian crude oil by March 2023 compared to 70 in November 2020. The news agency also stated earlier this year that Venezuela’s national oil company PDVSA had leased 41 tankers in 2022 to ship Venezuela crude oil, paying roughly double the market rate. In an earlier Reuters article, it was estimated that there were more than 200 tankers, including over 80 supertankers, shipping Iranian and Venezuelan crude oil. Latest estimates from a variety of sources put the number of vessels in the dark fleet at a far higher number. According to maritime AI company Windward there are 1,100 vessels in the dark fleet, with around 32% crude oil tankers, another 20% being oil product vessels, and the remainder comprised of chemical as well as other types of tankers. Analysts from other data broker firms put the number of vessels at around 700, but given the fleet’s opaque nature, it is difficult to determine the correct number. While PDVSA has its own fleet of 22 tankers, a recent internal report claimed that at least half of them are in such poor condition, they are unfit to ship crude oil. It is for that reason, along with growing oil production, that a larger dark fleet will be beneficial for Venezuela.  Related: Bitcoin Sinks As Crypto Companies Grapple With SEC Lawsuits A combination of endemic corruption and malfeasance, sharply weaker oil prices, a lack of skilled labor and strict U.S. sanctions saw Venezuela’s economic backbone, its petroleum industry, almost collapse. Against all odds, with the assistance of Russia, China and Iran, the national oil company PDVSA was able to rebuild some corroded energy infrastructure and bolster oil production. According to data supplied by Caracas to OPEC, Venezuela pumped an average of 810,000 barrels per day during April 2023, which was not only 7% higher than a month prior but 4.5% greater year over year. This is nearly triple the record low of 390,000 barrels per day during July 2020, when petroleum production plunged because of sharply weaker prices and the COVID-19 pandemic. The reconstruction of Venezuela’s heavily corroded oil industry is crucial to returning the economy to growth. Every year from 2014 until 2021, Venezuela’s gross domestic product contracted, plunging by 80% or $171 billion. This has been labeled as the modern world’s worst economic collapse to occur outside of war which saw over seven million Venezuelans flee the country, which was once the wealthiest in Latin America. Surprisingly, for 2021 Venezuela’s economy had returned to growth, expanding by 0.5% that year and then by a notable 8% in 2022. Key to this remarkable development was Venezuela restoring oil production and securing access to crucial energy export markets, which is where access to the dark fleet is pivotal. While U.S. sanctions had constrained Venezuela’s economy for some time, it wasn’t until President Donald Trump enacted his policy of maximum pressure that cut Caracas off from global energy and capital markets that it crashed. It was Teheran that provided the skilled technicians, critical parts and crucial condensate that were essential to rebuilding heavily corroded oil infrastructure and thereby boosting petroleum production. Ongoing reliable supplies of condensate are especially important to PDVSA, particularly since U.S. supplies ended with Trump’s January 2019 sanctions. The very-light high API hydrocarbon is a vital ingredient for processing and upgrading Venezuela’s heavy and ultra-heavy crude oil to exportable grades. It was the provision of a reliable supply from Iran that was key to PDVA growing oil production. While Iran’s condensate is still crucial to PDVSA’s operations, energy supermajor Chevron, which was permitted by the U.S. Treasury to recommence lifting petroleum in Venezuela in November 2022, is sourcing U.S.-supplied naphtha for heavy oil upgrading. Chevron is required to do this because of U.S. sanctions on Iranian crude oil and related products because U.S. sanctions block Chevron from making any payments to Caracas. As a result, all petroleum lifted by the U.S. energy supermajor will be utilized in an oil-for debt swap, with Chevron seeking to recover $3 billion in outstanding debt with PDVSA by the end of 2025. This emphasizes just how important the dark fleet, including Iranian tankers, is to PDVSA to ship oil to global energy markets in order to receive urgently required cash payments. Asia is the main destination for Venezuelan crude oil, with China believed to be receiving the bulk of those exports. A larger dark fleet makes it easier for PDVSA to not only ship oil to buyers undetected, in contravention of U.S. sanctions but also to ramp up export volumes which are vital for boosting income and sustaining Venezuela’s economy’s return to growth. In fact, higher oil production and exports saw the IMF predict that Venezuela’s GDP will expand by 5% in 2023.",NeutralChina Consolidates Grip On Key Oil Transit Routes.html,"Following the recent slew of major cooperation agreements (including in energy, security, and logistics) between various permutations of Iran, Iraq, Russia, and China, another set of agreements – this time between Iran and Oman – allows Beijing to further consolidate its grip over the principal oil transit routes from the Middle East. It also allows it the opportunity to develop another major source of liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies, to the detriment of the U.S.’s key allies in Europe. Four deals were signed within the last week or so, focused on the economic, investment, free trade, and energy sectors. Most notable of the energy sector deals made public was for the joint study of the Hengam oil and gas field. This is the first publicised agreement on cooperation between Iran and a neighbouring country in a shared field, although, as analysed in depth in my new book on the new global oil market order, Iran and Iraq have been closely cooperating on their many shared fields for decades. The Hengam field lies around 70 kilometres off the southern Iranian coast, to the north of Oman, at the juncture of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman that sits almost exactly in the centre of the Strait of Hormuz. This point is the key global transit route for around 30-40 percent of all the world’s oil at any given moment. This is one of the two key reasons why this deal is so important to China, Iran, and to the global oil markets - far more than the estimated 700 million barrels of oil and two trillion cubic feet of gas that the Hengam field contains. One of China’s core strategic aims as exercised in practice through its ‘One Belt, One Road’ multi-generational power-grab project is to control all of the transport routes for the world’s oil and LNG supplies that come out of the Middle East, as also analysed in depth in my new book on the new global oil market order. China already had much control over the  Strait of Hormuz through its all-encompassing 25-year deal with Iran, first reported exclusively by me back in September 2019. The same deal also gives China a hold over the Bab al-Mandab Strait, through which crude oil is shipped upwards through the Red Sea towards the Suez Canal before moving into the Mediterranean and then westwards. This has been achieved as it lies between Yemen - formerly heavily controlled by Iran-backed Houthis, but also now subject to the new China-brokered relationship deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia - and Djibouti, over which China has also established a stranglehold. What the recent seizure by Iran of the Advantage Sweet oil tanker also showed is that the Gulf of Oman can no longer be regarded as a safe alternative transport route for oil tankers either. This new deal for the Hengam oil and gas field will further cement China’s grip over all Middle Eastern oil and LNG transit routes.  Related: Shell Halts Unit At Europe’s Biggest Refinery Due To Leak It is important to reiterate at this point that all the Middle East’s oil and gas exports are at a once-in-a-lifetime tipping point as to where they would be sent in the event of a major crisis between the U.S. and its allies, and China and its allies, such as occurred on a more limited scale after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. This crucial part of the new global oil market order, as analysed in my new book on that very subject, saw the U.S. make great efforts to secure for its allies in Europe crucial new energy supplies from the Middle East and North Africa to make up for previous Russian supplies lost due to sanctions. It also saw China, a net energy importer itself, do the same. This re-ordering of the alliances of the major Middle Eastern oil and gas producers is still ongoing, but China had great success in broadening and deepening its relationships with several key Middle Eastern countries from 2018 to 2022. This period saw the U.S. step back from its previous role of being the ‘global policeman’, as the Truman Doctrine implied.  Specifically, as also analysed in my new book, after the unilateral withdrawal of the U.S. from the ‘nuclear deal’ with Iran in May 2018 and the subsequent withdrawals from Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq, China had been so successful in stepping into the power vacuum created that it was able to broker the ‘impossible deal’ – the resumption of relations between the historical enemies of Iran and Saudi Arabia. China’s interim progress in this regard can also be seen from a series of meetings in Beijing at the end of December 2021/beginning of January 2022 between senior officials from the Chinese government and foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, plus the secretary-general of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). At these meetings, the principal topics of conversation were to finally seal a China-GCC FTA and to forge “a deeper strategic cooperation in a region where U.S. dominance is showing signs of retreat.” Additionally, Saudi Arabia’s very public announcement in April this year that its cabinet had approved a plan to join the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) as a ‘dialogue partner’ is the surest sign yet that any U.S. efforts to keep it out of the China-Russia sphere of influence may now be futile. With the Iran-Oman relationship now even tighter – a move long opposed by the U.S. – China can move ahead with plans to build out Iran’s LNG capabilities, which will marry Iran’s vast gas resources with Oman’s underused LNG production facilities. This is again much more important than just finally giving Iran an LNG industry, for two key reasons. First, LNG is the new emergency energy staple of the U.S.’s key allies in Europe, as was evidenced in the desperate scramble to secure such supplies for Germany in the immediate aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. If these new LNG deals had not been secured by the U.S. for Germany at that time then there was little doubt that the European Union (E.U.) would have done nothing significant to punish Russia for the invasion. Indeed, it was the E.U.’s fear of losing cheap plentiful supplies of Russian gas and oil that was the primary reason why it allowed Russia to annex all of Ukraine’s Crimea region back in 2014 with no real consequences, as also analysed in depth in my new book on the new global oil market order.  The second key reason why this creation by China of a major Iranian LNG capability is so important is that it will give China more leverage to keep the world’s biggest exporter of LNG – Qatar – firmly on its side when the crunch point comes between the U.S. and China. This leverage will accrue from the fact that Iranian LNG will come not just from the giant North Pars gas field but also from the supergiant South Pars gas field, which is one part of the two parts of the world’s largest gas reservoir that it shares with neighbouring Qatar (in the form of the ‘North Dome’, or ‘North Field’). The North Dome is by far Qatar’s chief source of income, and the manner of Iranian gas production from the South Pars field has a direct consequence on the output and longevity of gas from Qatar’s side of the shared reservoir. Additionally confirming its hold over Qatar, both before and during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, China made a series of long-term deals with Qatar for massive supplies of LNG.  It is little wonder then that Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi announced in the last week or so that Iran-Oman relations have been promoted from ‘commercial’ stage to ‘investment’ phase. The Iranian president added that the sectors of energy, industry, trade, communications, defence and security affairs, road and rail lines, maritime transport and transit, and financial and monetary exchanges – all key areas of China’s own 25-year deal with Iran, and crucial parts of its ‘One Belt, One Road’ program - are all areas in which the two countries will expand their cooperation.",NegTraders Arent Buying The Oil Deficit Story.html,"Traders are not buying the oil deficit story. That’s the conclusion that forces itself based on the latest oil and fuel buying and selling developments ahead of the latest OPEC+ meeting. The price movements that followed that meeting were proof that this attitude was correct. The initial price jump that every production cut announcement from OPEC+ causes fizzled out less than a day after the announcement. Over the past six weeks, institutional traders have reduced their positions in crude oil and fuels by 238 million barrels, Reuters’ John Kemp reported earlier this week, which was one of the lowest weekly positions in those contracts since 2013. These six weeks were marked by some strongly bearish developments reinforcing the sentiment, such as weaker than expected Chinese economic index readings and the U.S. debt ceiling negotiations. It appears that traders have focused entirely on those economic index readings instead of the fact that Chinese crude oil demand hit a record in April despite refineries shutting down for seasonal maintenance. They also did not really acknowledge U.S. legislators’ success in passing the debt ceiling bill that averted a federal debt default, even though the uncertainty surrounding the issue was a major driver for bullish behavior on the oil market. Perhaps this has something to do with news about a recession in the U.S. manufacturing and freight transport sectors, which has hurt oil consumption in these industries. It seems that institutional oil traders have been focusing almost exclusively on consumption lately.  Related: Shell Halts Unit At Europe’s Biggest Refinery Due To Leak If analysts, who almost invariably predict much higher oil prices for the second half of the year, are right, this could boomerang. But if traders’ fears of a recession materialize, oil prices will be going nowhere near $100. In fact, prices might even fall further. This would be good news for the White House: it has set a range of $67 to $72 per barrel to refill the strategic petroleum reserve. The twist is that the moment the Department of Energy starts buying oil for the SPR, prices will jump. It will not be good news for OPEC, however. The cartel cannot keep cutting deeper and deeper – at some point, this will start playing to the advantage of U.S. shale. In fact, according to some, it already is, with analysts predicting higher U.S. exports as Saudi Arabia trims production by another 1 million bpd. Meanwhile, Germany has officially fallen into recession, which has likely reinforced expectations of a faster slowdown elsewhere as well, which has dampened appetite for oil, inelastic or not. And since the non-news of the German recession broke after months of upbeat messaging that the worst was over and the EU’s largest economy was in fact, recovering, hedge funds and other institutional traders have every reason to play it safe. The U.S. is not out of the woods yet, either. Per Reuters’ Kemp, “Only the residual strength of service sector spending has so far prevented the “industrial recession” becoming a whole-economy recession.” That wouldn’t be a good sign for oil demand in the world’s largest consumer, and oil traders appear to be acting in anticipation of that recession. Importantly, they are acting in this way regardless of OPEC+ actions aimed at curbing supply in a way that should return the market to balance.ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Some analysts said it last year, using the age-old adage that the cure for high oil prices was high oil prices. This time, the cure was a slowdown or outright recession. Many wondered if the cure wasn’t going to be worse than the disease. It now appears we might get a chance to see if this is the case.",NegRussian Oil Output Remains High Much To OPECs Dismay.html,"Russian crude oil export data in recent weeks have not reflected any cuts and OPEC+ allies are increasingly frustrated with its non-compliance Russia’s crude oil exports by sea continue to stay high as the latest four-week average shows that shipments are inching up, much to the frustration of its partners in the OPEC+ deal. In the four weeks to June 4, the four-week average Russian crude exports by sea rose to 3.73 million barrels per day (bpd), up from a revised 3.68 million bpd in the four weeks to May 28, tanker-tracking data monitored by Bloomberg showed on Tuesday.   Russian crude oil shipments are 1.4 million bpd above the level from the end of 2022, more than can be accounted for by Germany and Poland stopping Russian crude imports by pipeline, or lower refinery throughput, Bloomberg’s Julian Lee notes.  On Sunday, the OPEC+ producers decided to keep the current cuts until the end of 2024, while OPEC’s top producer and the world’s largest crude oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, said it would voluntarily reduce its production by 1 million bpd in July, to around 9 million bpd. Russia has said it would reduce its oil production by 500,000 bpd from March. The 500,000 bpd cuts will now extend until the end of 2023, and after Sunday’s meeting – to the end of 2024.   However, Russian crude oil export data in recent weeks have not reflected any cuts—on the contrary, Russian crude oil exports by sea have been rising.  It looks like Saudi Arabia is fed up with a lack of clarity about Russia’s actual production levels and higher supply to the Asian markets, which is hampering the Saudi attempts to raise oil prices. Russia has stopped reporting oil production levels, and the market and analysts have to rely on vessel-tracking data, trade sources, and import statistics in China and India about the amount of Russian supply.  After the OPEC+ meeting in Vienna this weekend, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said, referring to Russia, “We discussed with Russia the issue of its production and asked it to clarify its data, and we have strengthened the concept of transparency with Russia about its oil production figures.”ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT",NeutralSaudi Surprise Cut Signals OPEC Crisis.html,"Following a suspense-filled weekend in Vienna, where OPEC oil ministers attempted to downplay media attention, global oil markets remain uncertain about the direction of oil prices. The recent ""surprise"" oil production cut announced by Saudi Arabia's Minister of Energy, Prince Abdelaziz bin Salman, has failed to restore confidence in the increasingly fragile OPEC+ alliance. Pressured by his own remarks and attempts to limit coverage by critical reporters, OPEC's leading member had no choice but to bear the burden of yet another production cut. Many analysts expected OPEC+ to extend the existing cuts, while neglecting the real underlying issue. The lack of transparency from Russia regarding its oil production and exports, coupled with Moscow's refusal to discuss potential new cuts, has placed a strain on the OPEC+ alliance. While all members have managed to mitigate the damage temporarily, the outcomes and statements suggest a scorching summer ahead. Diverting attention to 2024 deflects from the pressing concerns at hand. Over the past week, global oil markets have been dominated by the statements of Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdelaziz bin Salman, particularly his comments on short sellers during a summit in Doha, Qatar. These remarks sparked optimism among bullish traders, who interpreted them as a signal of potential production cuts. However, Prince Abdelaziz's stance on critical journalism, particularly with renowned media outlets like Bloomberg, exposed the fragile internal cohesion within OPEC. Russian Energy Minister Novak's statement that there is no need for additional cuts further aggravated Saudi concerns, undermining any prospects of genuine cooperation between the two parties and leaving the OPEC+ alliance hanging by a thread.  Related: ExxonMobil: New Fracking Technology Can Double Oil Output Simultaneously, other key OPEC members, notably the UAE and various African nations, have been pushing in the opposite direction. Abu Dhabi, having made substantial investments in its upstream sector, is seeking ways to capitalize on its increased production capacity in the coming years. OPEC's current production cuts hinder this objective, as future volume increases will be restricted. Similarly, African members like Nigeria and Angola find themselves in a similar position, with their current production volumes not aligning with their nominal production capacities. OPEC's move to reassess African quotas based on their actual production levels is perceived as a direct threat to their future prospects. The dynamics within OPEC are fraught with tensions, as conflicting interests and divergent objectives strain the alliance. The delicate balance between short sellers, critical journalism, production cuts, and individual member ambitions has pushed OPEC to the brink, jeopardizing its future stability. Although Saudi Prince Abdulaziz expressed trust in Russia's commitment to the production cuts in a recent interview, emphasizing the need to ""trust but verify"" with the assistance of secondary sources, this statement should not be underestimated. Russia’s current production and export strategy starkly contradicts the existing agreement. It is evident that Moscow is unwilling to curtail its exports, as it requires substantial funds to fund its war in Ukraine, all the while witnessing a gradual erosion of its regional power base. Financing is crucial for the survival of Putin's regime, particularly in the light of the potential offensive by Ukraine's armed forces to push back Russian troops in the occupied territories.  Until now, Saudi Arabia has remained committed to sustaining the pro-Russian cooperation within OPEC+, but it is becoming increasingly apparent that Riyadh is slowly realizing the limitations imposed upon itself by aligning closely with Putin's interests. The implications of this association are being recognized by Saudi Arabia, highlighting the constraints it has placed on its own decision-making and strategic maneuverability. Another major concern is the increasingly difficult oil market cooperation between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). While speculations about the UAE leaving OPEC remain unfounded, internal tensions within the alliance are apparent. UAE's Energy Minister, Suhail, stated that Abu Dhabi will extend its voluntary cut of 144,000 bpd until the end of December 2024, as a precautionary measure in coordination with other participating countries in the OPEC+ agreement. He reiterated that this cut would be from the required production level agreed upon at the thirty-fifth ministerial meeting of OPEC+ on June 4, 2023. It is essential to view this statement as a diplomatic gesture towards Saudi Arabia, rather than openly questioning the UAE's commitment to cooperation. However, in reality, this voluntary cut is minimal and places extreme pressure on the leadership in Abu Dhabi to navigate a challenging path. Sustaining the cuts until the end of 2024 is unrealistic, both for OPEC and global oil supply. Undoubtedly, there will be an increase in demand in 2023, even if the anticipated 800,000 bpd demand increase from China falls short of expectations. The UAE’s balancing act poses significant challenges. The sustainability of the extended cuts and the broader cohesion within OPEC remain uncertain amidst shifting market dynamics and divergent objectives among member countries.  In the short term, some upward price movements will be seen. A cut normally always has some bullish impact. However, when the bearish narrative of recession fears reemerges, the sentiment in oil markets could turn sour once again.  Overall, the risk for the oil market cannot be underestimated. Instability within OPEC+ bad news. Saudi Arabia needed to put its money where its mouth was last week, but forgot that the reactions from its OPEC peers might not be positive at all, and that additional cuts do not necessarily guarantee higher oil revenues. The escalating crisis between Saudi Arabia and Russia has now become apparent for all to see. What was once dubbed an ""unholy alliance"" by some has unraveled due to Moscow's increasing desperation for cash and geopolitical influence, which no longer aligns with the interests of the other parties involved. Prince Abdulaziz will soon find himself in a position where he must address his own brother, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and explain why the current course of action will fail to generate additional revenues. The success of Saudi Vision 2030 is pivotal, not only for the stability of crude oil prices but also for the future trajectory of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman himself. This uncertainty may bring the return of the more self-centered production policies, such as we’ve seen in 2020. If some OPEC+ members will decide to unilaterally increase their own export volumes, this may upset other OPEC+ members which could opt to do the same, causing oil prices to plunge as a result. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT",PosOil Majors Keen On Libyas Untapped Potential.html,"Following the failed Presidential elections of December 2021 and its negative impact on the oil and gas industry, Libya’s oil production started to get back on track in the second half of 2022, aimed at boosting production in line with high global demand and elevated prices. And things are looking up for 2023, with increased foreign investment in Libya’s oil and gas sector, as well as support from the IMF. The government hopes to improve national industry standards to meet international expectations through its new strategic plan, helping to boost production and attract investment in new projects.  In February this year, the NOC introduced a new strategic plan to revitalise Libya’s oil and gas sector, in collaboration with the U.S. firm KBR. It created the Strategic Programs Office to implement this plan to help the company “keep pace with developments in this sector worldwide.” The strategy is expected to help the Libyan National Oil Corporation (NOC) increase Libya’s oil output to 2 million bpd in three to five years, from around 1.2 million bpd at present. The country’s output stood at around 1.6 million bpd prior to the 2011 Arab Spring but has been steadily decreasing ever since, due to political volatility and conflict. But to achieve this output increase, Libya needs to attract much more investment in its oil and gas industry, particularly in exploration, to ensure the longevity of the sector.  Iliasse Sdiqui, associate director at Whispering Bell, a risk management company covering North Africa, stated: “The idea is that to draw foreign investment you need to be more transparent, and you need to enable IOCs to take a look at your books.” Sdiqui added, “This strategic program office is (set up) both to enable IOCs to be comfortable with channelling money into the east and also to satisfy the local communities in the region.” And “The pressure for more fiscal transparency comes from the top, from the US, and from the international community.” Under the plan, new oil and gas blocks will be offered for exploration for the first time in more than 17 years. In May, three international oil majors, Italian Eni, French Total, and UAE-based Adnoc, entered into talks with the NOC about the potential development and exploration of oil and gas fields in the NC7 block in the Ghadames Basin. Eni continues to be the biggest foreign investor in Libya’s oil and gas sector, having begun operations in 1959. The company produced 198 Bcf of gas in Libya in 2021 and transported the gas to Italy via the 520-km Green Stream pipeline.  In February, Eni became the first international oil company to announce a new project in Libya for more than two decades. Eni signed an agreement with the NOC to develop offshore operations aimed at producing 750 MMcf/d of natural gas by tapping estimated reserves of 6 trillion cubic feet. The IMF expects Libya’s oil production to increase by around 15 percent in 2023 thanks to an output rise of 1 million bpd in 2022. The IMF stated, “Libya’s economic fortunes will hinge on oil and gas production for the foreseeable future.” The country has long been highly dependent on revenues from oil and gas production, holding around 3 percent of the world’s oil reserves and 39 percent of Africa’s. At present, Libya’s financial stability is under threat from the global green transition, suggesting the need for greater economic diversification to ensure increased security in the future. But for now, the country’s oil and gas industry is performing much better than expected coming out of the turmoil of 2021.  In May, Zallaf Libya Oil and Gas, a subsidiary of the NOC, announced that output at the Erawin oilfield has increased to more than 92,000 bpd. The company hopes to achieve 100,000 bpd of production at Erawin. And the Russian oil company Tatneft’s Libyan branch discovered an oil well in the Ghadames Basin, producing 1,870 bpd of at a depth of 8,500 feet.  In addition to increasing output, Libya hopes to improve the standards of oil production to meet international expectations to enhance the export potential and attract greater investment in the sector. Farhat Bengdara, NOC’s chairman, stated that the company is aiming to increase production as well as to reach global standards in the sector. He suggested that raising output will help to boost the salaries of those working in oil and gas, as well as helping to stabilise the exchange rate of the dollar and boosting energy security.  Thanks to the introduction of a new strategic plan, Libya has begun to boost its oil output as well as attract greater foreign attention. The hope is to improve standards to encourage new foreign investments in exploration and production operations while the global demand for oil and gas remains high. Revenues from new projects could also help Libya to pursue a strategy of economic diversification to enhance its financial stability in a global green transition. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT",NegMexicos Energy Conundrum AMLOs Nationalization Plans Face Scrutiny.html,"Mexico’s state-owned oil company Pemex has faced challenge after challenge, following scrutiny over its poor safety standards and low production levels and now it’s likely to miss the scheduled launch of its new refinery. The indebted oil firm was expected to open the new Olmeca refinery last December before it announced it was postponing the opening until July this year due to construction delays. Mexico’s once-thriving oil and gas industry has faced several setbacks in recent years, with Pemex being hit hard. But, with several new projects in the works, can it get back on track? The launch of Pemex’s new Olmeca refinery is expected to once again be delayed according to an internal audit report. The report stated that the target of a July launch was “not feasible”. The facility, located at the Dos Bocas port in Tabasco, was set to start producing 170,000 bpd of processed oil next month. However, the report suggests that the construction of the refinery’s coking plants, required to process Pemex’s heavy crude, is “not yet finished.” When the media outlet Reuters asked Pemex about the delay it was redirected to the Energy Ministry, which AMLO has put in charge of the project, to which it received no reply.  The refinery is set to transform Mexico’s oil industry, with a projected processing capacity of 340,000 bpd of oil. It will be the biggest of Pemex’s seven facilities. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, known as AMLO, has pushed for the nationalisation of the country’s energy since he came to office in 2018. He has since approved several new oil and gas projects and hoped the Olmeca refinery would provide a much-needed boost in the domestic production of motor fuels, thereby decreasing reliance on foreign supplies. He aims to replace the country’s foreign gasoline supplies with domestic production by 2024.  There has been much criticism around many of AMLO’s energy nationalisation plans in recent years. The Olmeca refinery has gone over its initial budget several times, with a final price tag of nearly double the 2020 projected cost of $8.9 billion. It is now also expected to have a lower processing capacity, of around 280,000 bpd. One Pemex executive stated of AMLO’s aim for fuel independence, “It's really more of a political statement than a reachable goal.”  While oil production has been rising, standing at an average of 322,000 bpd in April, the highest since July 2010, gasoline output has dropped. Production of the fuel averaged 291,000 bpd in April, down 4 percent from last year and 10 percent from 2016 levels. The challenge mainly centres around difficulties in processing Mexico’s heavy crude. Refining the oil requires the use of a coking plant to extract high-value fuel, such as gasoline and diesel. At present, Pemex is only using around 54 percent of its 1.6 million bpd crude processing capacity across six refineries. ALMO had hoped that investments in upgrading the facilities would help boost production, but this has yet to be seen.  Critiques have also been made over AMLO’s decision to purchase a 50 percent stake in the Deer Park refinery in Texas from Shell. One Houston-based oil and gas sector expert, George Baker, believes the move to purchase the refinery was purely symbolic. He explained that the financial reports from 2021 show the facility had cumulative losses of $360 million. Baker stated, “It continues to lose money, why should that be true, and that actually makes you ask the question: Why is Pemex buying a money-losing operation?... The whole notion is just generally for the symbolism of it.”  Experts believe that the purchase of Deer Park and the upgrading of Mexico’s existing refineries will do little to boost the production of Pemex’s heavy crude. Processing the oil is highly contaminating and bad for air quality when burnt to generate electricity because of its high sulphur content, which has decreased its market value. Further, the majority of Mexico’s refineries were designed to process lighter grades of crudes, when that was what Pemex produced, and are not well suited to refining heavy crude.  While AMLO’s nationalisation plans appear to be less effective than initially hoped, Pemex has been able to gradually rise its out output, against all odds in light of its $108 billion debt at the end of 2022. The firm saw its sixth consecutive month of increased production in April. And while it may continue to rely on exporting this crude to foreign powers for processing, it is a major turnaround from the failures seen in recent years. ALMO may not succeed in his aim for fuel independence by 2024, but his investment in oil and gas has somewhat revitalised Mexico’s flailing industry, and foreign partnerships could help to keep the industry afloat.",NegOPEC Discussing 1 Million Bpd Output Cut.html,"Oil prices were trading up on Friday afternoon as shorters got a little nervous heading into the OPEC+ weekend, with new rumors circulating about the group’s discussions about another 1 million bpd in production cuts. The OPEC+ group is scheduled for three separate meetings beginning this weekend and concluding on June 4. While the general sentiment has been that the group will keep the status quo as far as production targets are concerned. But Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister has made boistrous threats against oil’s speculators in the runup to the meeting, saying that shorters will be “ouching”. On Thursday, Reuters suggested that the OPEC+ group would be unlikely to deepen its production targets at the meeting this weekend. But late on Friday, Reuters suggested that OPEC+ was indeed discussing an additional output cut of around 1 million barrels “among possible options” for the meeting on June 4. Crude oil prices were already trading up ahead of the meeting, but increased even more in the afternoon hours, bringing Brent crude to $76.32 at 4:20 p.m., a $2.06 per barrel increase on the day. WTI was trading at $71.90 per barrel at that time. The OPEC meeting will begin at 1 pm Vienna time tomorrow, with OPEC+ meeting on Sunday. The latest price hike could prompt OPEC+ to keep production targets the same. But Saudi Arabia appears to still be in control of OPEC+, and he could decide to make good on his threats to punish short sellers for their speculative trades that fly in the face of market fundamentals. “I keep advising them (referencing oil speculators) that they will be ouching, they did ouch in April, I don’t have to show my cards. I am not a poker player…but I would just tell them watch out,” Saudi’s energy minister said late last month in the runup to the meeting.",PosInsurers Signal Fallout From Sanctions On Russia.html,"A year ago, the Financial Times reported how maritime insurers were concerned that sanctions targeting Russian oil exports would disrupt global supply chains, lead to higher prices, and make life for shippers and insurers more stressful. This week, the same publication sounded the sanction alarm again. But it is no longer a general concern about supply chains, oil prices, and the price cap compliance woes of shippers and insurers. It is now a much more direct concern about how cap-compliant companies are suffering lost business as Russia's shadow fleet rises. If the past year has taught the sanction enforcers anything, it is that there is a way around everything. They should have actually seen it with Iran and Venezuela, but apparently they didn't, so they barraged Russia with sanctions expecting it to collapse within months. Instead, Russian oil exports are on the rise—to the reported chagrin of its OPEC partner Saudi Arabia—despite the EU embargo and the price cap that the G7 came up with to make sure the global market remains well supplied. The group has hailed the cap as a success, ignoring evidence of Russian oil being sold over it. ""If the aim of sanctions is to make a state alter course, the test of success would be to ask whether the target country has changed its actions,"" the head of marine and aviation at insurance trade body Lloyd's Market Association wrote in a letter cited by the FT.  Related: Russia’s Seaborne Diesel Exports Plummet In May ""What is unclear to industry is why policymakers believe that 20 years of Russian inculcation and perceived grievance will be materially altered through further constraints against shipping and insurance,"" Neil Roberts also wrote in the letter, published on LinkedIn. He then went on to warn that any further sanctions that are currently being mulled over by Western government were unlikely to have any impact on Russia foreign policy but would definitely hurt ""the world's legitimate floating supply system."" It appears that there was one thing Western governments forgot while they were devising their sanction punch against Russian oil. What they forgot was the fact that there aren't only insurers and shippers in the West. There are Russian insurance companies willing to provide coverage for tankers. There are Indian insurers and Chinese shippers. And they are happy to do business, as evidenced by the recent news around Indian shipping company Gatik. Gatik got punished by Lloyd's Register for carrying Russian oil, presumably above the cap, but just days later, an Indian insurer stepped up to provide the necessary coverage for the firm's vessels, as noted by Roberts in his LinkedIn post. Then there is the shadow fleet of tankers operated by small, unknown companies that carries millions of Russian barrels of oil and fuels across oceans on a daily basis. According to Trafigura, as of February this year, the shadow fleet numbered some 600 vessels. The commodity trader referred to it as ""huge"". ""There's a lot of people talking about how they can be clever and get rid of Russian oil. But it is a vast volume that needs to find a new home,"" Trafigura's co-head of oil trading, Ben Luckock, told Bloomberg at the time. ""I think in the early days maybe that's okay, but as time progresses there will be difficulties in the products markets."" These would be the same people that are currently discussing yet another package of sanctions that would also target countries doing business—including oil business-with Russia. Per a Bloomberg report, the discussion is still ongoing, and it is unlikely that the EU would go straight to blacklisting and punishing Russia's trade partners, such as India and China. Yet the next sanction package may well include measures targeting companies from these countries. While the EU discusses more sanctions, its sanction push against Russia got a reality check from a Finnish think tank that tracks Russia's oil exports and revenues. That think tank, the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, found that Russia's oil revenues are on the rise, too, after dipping in the first two months of the year, to return to levels from last November—before the EU embargo and the price cap kicked in.ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT This may well be why insurers are speaking up despite the danger of being criticized for not praising sanctions uncritically. It appears that the push to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine is backfiring and hurting insurers and shippers in the West disproportionately.  It was to be expected. There really could not be any way things could have played out, not in a world that depends on crude oil. As proven time and again, oil always finds a way to reach consumers. And while the embargo and the price cap certainly deprived Russia of some oil revenues, they seem to have deprived Western shippers and insurers of more than some revenues.",NeutralOil Jumps As EIA Reports Surprise Crude Build.html,"Crude oil prices moved higher moments before the Energy Information Administration reported an inventory build of 4.5 million barrels for the week to May 26. At 459.7 million barrels, crude oil inventories in the U.S. are around 2% below the five-year average for this time of the year. Last week’s change compares with a substantial draw of 12.5 million barrels for the previous week, which caused prices to jump but only for a short while. This week, the American Petroleum Institute surprised markets with a large inventory build estimate that pressured prices on Wednesday but Thursday presented a chance for a reversal as the House of Representatives voted for the debt ceiling suspension deal agreed by President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Meanwhile, the EIA reported a 200,000-barrel inventory draw in gasoline, with production averaging 10 million barrels daily in the week to May 26. This compared with a draw of 2.1 million barrels for the previous week, when production averaged 10.3 million barrels daily. In middle distillates, the authority estimated an inventory build of 1 million barrels for the week to May 26, and a production rate of 5 million bpd. This compared with an inventory draw of 600,000 barrels for the previous week, when production averaged 4.9 million bpd. At the time of writing, Brent crude traded at $73.11 per barrel, with West Texas Intermediate at $68.86 per barrel, both up since opening on the day when Midland crude joins the Brent basket. This is the first time a non-European crude oil grade will be part of the global benchmark. Meanwhile, a poll Reuters ran among economists has suggested that prices will not be able to top $100 this year, remaining below $90 per barrel for the remainder of the year. According to the respondents in the poll, Brent will average $84.73 per barrel this year, while West Texas Intermediate will average $79.20 per barrel. Both figures were downward revisions on earlier forecasts.ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT",PosArgentinas Vaca Muerta Shale Play Could Produce 1 Million Bpd In 2030.html,"Crude oil production from Argentina’s burgeoning shale patch, Vaca Muerta, could surge in the coming years and top 1 million barrels per day (bpd) by the end of the decade – but only if takeaway capacity and rig availability do not limit growth. Rystad Energy’s modeling shows that if production is relatively unimpeded, oil output could realistically grow from 291,000 bpd in February 2023 to more than 1 million bpd in the second half of 2030. The forecast growth could lift Vaca Muerta’s profile and position it as a leading source of shale production, alongside the likes of the Bakken or Eagle Ford developments, two of the US’ world-class shale basins. It would also help the Neuquen region become a net oil exporter, potentially contributing $20 billion in total revenue by 2030. Crude exports could be making their way to South American neighbors Brazil, Chile and Peru, as well as the US and Europe. Still, big question marks remain, which could potentially alter our long-term growth outlook. Takeaway capacity constraints linger, and rig availability remains an ongoing concern. The learning curve for operators in the basin has been steep, and they will need to continue this trend to maximize their production potential. If all industry participants work together to address these constraints before they become critical, output could top 1 million bpd sooner rather than later.  “Vaca Muerta could hold the key to Argentina’s future energy economy following more than a decade of oil production declines. While major challenges lie ahead, reaching the important 1 million barrels per day threshold would change the country’s narrative, reduce its reliance on imports and become a key regional and global oil market player,” says Alexandre Ramos Peon, head of shale research at Rystad Energy.  Related: Goldman And Others Sees Rising Odds Of Another OPEC+ Output Cut  State of the play As of February, Vaca Muerta’s gross oil production reached 291,000 bpd, an annual addition of 76,000 bpd. Production from majors – Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and TotalEnergies – increased by 62% in 2022 compared to 2021, followed by other local and international players and YPF, the nation’s state-run giant. Gas output from other local and international players (excluding Tecpetrol) and YPF grew 63% and 43%, respectively, followed by majors and Tecpetrol. In February, daily gas output rose to 1.84 Bcfd (billion cubic feet per day), 15% more than the same month in 2022. Vaca Muerta's production growth is impressive but not extraordinary, considering it remains a relatively young development. Significant regional developments started just a few years ago and accelerated in 2021 as the industry recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic. Path to 1 million bpd Rystad Energy has modeled a theoretical scenario based on existing trends and technologies to forecast total oil production from the shale patch until the end of 2030. In this scenario, we assume new wells that start production from now onwards have the same performance per foot as the average completed and put-on-production (POP) in 2021-2022; oil production from gas wells is negligible; capital re-investment is assured until 2030; linear growth in POP activity in 2023 and onwards. For the operators, we assumed that they adopt two-mile laterals gradually within the next three years. Finally, we considered no downturns in the oil industry, global pandemics, significant macroeconomic changes or political unrest in Argentina until 2030.  While concerns around growth persist, there are no issues with the quality of Vaca Muerta’s shale oil or its capacity to produce hydrocarbons at scale (after proper stimulation). Its shale is distinguished by its high pressures and substantial thickness. Its oil yield per foot is demonstrably superior to similar horizontal wells in major US shale plays.  Since the development of the play is relatively new, operators needed a period to adapt and find the ‘sweet spots’ when drilling and completing wells. For instance, Vaca Muerta operators have adopted US shale's proppant intensity and stage spacing trends in just a few years – going from 1,500 to 2,500 pounds of proppant per foot and from 250 to 210 feet stage spacing between 2018 to 2022. Additionally, simul-frac operations have been adopted by YPF and Pan American Energy, while Vista has created its first ‘hub,’ which processes hydrocarbons from two of their primary fields. The next step for Vaca Muerta operators is to standardize using two-plus mile laterals. The caveat is that normalizing extended-reach wells requires drilling contractors to bring into the region high-spec rigs capable of handling that level of workload. This brings us to the first significant bottleneck that could upset Vaca Muerta’s growth potential. With about 30 active rigs and an average drilling speed of 1.1 wells per rig per month, Neuquen’s Vaca Muerta could expect up to 400 new drilled wells in a year. Assuming the 70-30 oil-gas well completions ratio of 2022, the maximum possible number of oil wells drilled per year will, therefore, be 280. This ratio could, however, change soon, with the President Nestor Kirchner gas pipeline starting operations in June. If no new rigs are brought into the region, Vaca Muerta’s growth rate is set to slow in the next couple of years. Bringing in high-spec rigs could improve drilling rates to less than 20 days per well, like in the Permian Delaware and Bakken.ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Neuquen’s oil takeaway capacity is saturated, but several projects are due in the short term. If all these projects materialize as announced, Neuquen should have more than 1 million bpd of evacuation capacity by 2025. It is worth noting that if Argentina wants to become a net oil exporter, the Puerto Rosales oil export terminal in Bahia Blanca – Buenos Aires operated by Oiltanking Ebytem might need to expand in the short term to keep up with Neuquen’s volumes.",NegRosneft Q1 Profit Soars As Russian Oil Output Cuts Remain Invisible.html,"Russian state-run oil giant Rosneft saw its first-quarter 2023 net profit rise by over 45% to around $4 billion, beating analyst expectations as production increases despite Moscow’s 500,000 barrel-per-day output cuts that started three months ago.  In addition to a 45.5% jump in net profit, Rosneft, headed by Igor Sechin, said it saw EBITDA rise for the quarter by 25.1%, though revenue was down 1.1%. Analyst expectations based on Interfax polling were lower for net profit, revenue and EBITDA.Rosneft noted that Q1 oil production increased by 0.8% compared to the third quarter of last year, topping 4 million bpd. In mid-March, Russia said planned oil output cuts of 500,000 bpd would continue until the end of June. In early April, Moscow said it would extend the production cuts until the end of the year. While Russian oil flows (seaborne) appear to be slightly decreasing, according to Bloomberg, the market has not yet seen or felt any significant oil production cut from Russia. While Russian seaborne exports have lowered, Bloomberg shows they remain 270,000 bpd higher than February, which was the baseline volume for Russia’s 500,000 bpd output cut. Rosneft’s earnings follow those of Russian state-run gas giant Gazprom last week, which posted a significant drop FY 2022 profits amid sanctions and Europe’s push to reduce dependence on Russian gas. Gazprom FY 2022 profits came in at around $15.4 billion, 41% lower than in 2021. Gazprom blamed the drop on Moscow’s 2022 windfall tax.

But the real driver behind the latest dump is the reversal of last week's speculation that an OPEC+ cut may be coming following a thinly veiled threat by the Saudi energy minister.  Still, many were surprised by the speed and ferocity of the latest drop and as Goldman trader John Flood writes overnight, ""we were peppered with questions today on weakness in oil/broader commods complex."" His retort: ""sentiment around both muted Asia refining margins + European industrial recovery are headwinds. The potential US debt deal includes a resumption of US student loan repayments beginning in Sept which could weigh on discretionary spending and shows you how glass half empty the mkt has become."" Then there are the technicals: Goldman's futures strats estimate that CTAs are short $10 billion oil contracts, so positioning remains fairly, even though last week’s OPEC headline around warning speculators to “Watch Out” appears to have added some length early in the week , which this will is once again coming unwound after Novak's comments. As for this weekend’s OPEC meeting, Flood writes that ""it feels like expectations are pretty low. If they cut, it helps the front but builds spare capacity, if they don't, the mkt might wonder if $70 moves from a floor to a ceiling. All of this suggests any froth that might have been added last week has come out."" A more in-depth take was published this morning by Goldman's commodities team, in which Jeffrey Currie and Daan Struyven write that they ""expect the nine major OPEC+ producers which announced voluntary production cuts in April to keep production unchanged, but utilize some partly offsetting hawkish rhetoric."" One possibility, according to Goldman, is to officialize these voluntary cuts, and broaden the cuts to smaller producers. While constraints on production of these smaller producers imply only a modest hit from a broader announcement to actual output, the bank suspects the alliance will want to signal strong cohesion.  Related: Visualizing All New Renewables Projects In The U.S. In 2023 Meanwhile, Goldman forecasts a hold for major producers because they likely first want to observe the impact of fresh cuts which just started this month (actually, they haven't as Russia has been cutting output only verbally, while its exports remain near record high). As an aside, OPEC has never cut within three months of a previous cut with stocks as low as today. ""Signs that the market remains on track for H2 deficits, incomplete Russia compliance, and several recent comments by OPEC+ and US energy policymakers also support a hold"" according to Goldman., which lays out these four reasons why the major producers are likely to roll over output.   All that said, Goldman sees a ""sizeable 35% subjective probability"" that the major OPEC producers announce deeper cuts on Sunday because oil prices are clearly below our $80-85/bbl estimate of the OPEC put. Very low positioning, the Saudi determination not to give speculators free rein, and the decision to meet in person also suggest that deeper cuts will likely be discussed. Looking further out beyond Sunday’s meeting, Goldman believes that elevated OPEC pricing power should allow the group to deliver additional cuts if oil prices were to remain below $80/bbl in H2. Goldman is not the only one to assign non-trivial and rising odds of a rate cut: according to RBC, OPEC+ may agree to a “lean cut” to output when the group meets this weekend ""given the softness in oil prices and the ongoing need for higher revenues in producer countries."" In a note by RBC's Helima Croft, he writes that ""the decision to hold an in-person gathering in Vienna raises the prospect the group could implement a deeper cut to support prices"" although maintaining current output levels is also on the table. Croft notes that ""OPEC+ doesn’t want to be overtaken by macro headwinds and souring market sentiment"" and while there’s a corner of the market that thinks OPEC+ may return to a market share approach, ""there’s no sign Saudi Arabia is seeking to repeat the March 2020 price war with Moscow."" Finally, a third bank also chimed in overnight, when Standard Chartered said in a note that while ""fundamentals in the global oil market do not provide a case for OPEC+ output cuts, the poor macroeconomic environment does."" OPEC+ ministers could adopt a patient approach and keep current targets in expectation of higher prices as market tightens, wrote analysts including Emily Ashford and Suki Cooper who also note that if the group wants to be cautious, they could respond to concerns of macro-led shorts and make a further precautionary cut to signal that any likely macroeconomic downside has been covered. “We think the decision is finely balanced; while we detect no strong appetite among ministers for further cuts, we also detect no appetite to allow macro-led investors free rein to open up the downside for oil prices.”",NeutralHeadline Grabbing Deals Mask Big Drop In Shale MA.html,"Energy markets have been lackluster in the current year, and it appears the malaise and bearishness have spread into the M&A sector. Oil and gas executives have become increasingly hesitant to pull the trigger on new deals, with mergers in the U.S. energy sector decreasing both in volume and deal value.  While there have been some headline-grabbing big deals recently, on a quarterly basis the stats tell a different story.  According to GlobalData’s United States of America (USA) Lower 48 Unconventional Oil and Gas (Major Shale Plays) Market Analysis and Forecast, 2021-2026 report, shale-related deal volume fell a whopping 60% Y/Y with only 21 deals consummated during the quarter while total deal value fell 38%Y/Y to $9.5B. Most of those deals were struck in the Eagle Ford shale of South Texas, where assets can be purchased for the value of existing production alone. That’s quite unnerving considering that energy experts generally expected a deluge of M&A action with the sector enjoying some of its highest profits in years. The biggest deals during the quarter was the acquisition of Eagle Ford operator Ranger Oil by Canada's Baytex Energy (NYSE:BTE) for $2.5 billion as well as Chesapeake Energy’s (NASDAQ:CHK) asset sale to WildFire Energy for $1.42 billion as well as a separate $1.4 billion sales agreement with Britain's INEOS. ""The collapse in deal counts is really remarkable, with the low count likely the new normal in shale M&A. We are seeing far fewer opportunities for deals in the current market that is much more consolidated and has much less undeveloped resources,"" said Dittmar.  “While opportunities still exist, shale M&A may be in its latter stages"" Andrew Dittmar, a director at Enverus, has said, blaming low commodity prices for the sharp slowdown. Nevertheless, Enervus says that the total value of future deals is likely to rise again in the Permian, noting that top-tier locations there have sold for $2 million and up to $3 million meaning only companies with deep pockets will be able to buy into the basin.

Previously, oil and gas companies made numerous aggressive tactical or cyclical acquisitions in the wake of a price crash after many distressed assets became available on the cheap. However, the 2020 oil price crash that sent oil prices into negative territory has seen energy companies adopt a more restrained, strategic, and environment-focused approach to cutting M&A deals. Further, U.S. shale drillers have abandoned their trigger-happy drilling days and are mostly sticking to their pledge to cut costs, return money to shareholders in dividends and share buybacks, and also pay down debt. A similar narrative is playing out in Canada’s Oil Patch. After years in the doghouse, Canada’s famous Oil Patch is enjoying a rare oil boom with oil and gas revenues expected to reach record levels in the current year if prices remain elevated. Typically, during past oil booms after a downturn, Canada’s OilPatch went through a predictable pattern of new startups setting up shop; soaring land prices, and companies cranking up production. But things are playing out differently during the current boom cycle despite resurgent oil demand and oil prices at multi-year highs. ""I've never seen this kind of response to demand increases before--ever,"" Tamarack Valley Energy (OTCPK: TNEYF) CEO Brian Schmidt has told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). A recent report by BMO Capital Markets says the North American oil and gas sector is enjoying its strongest financial position in years, but the excess cash will largely be distributed to shareholders instead of going to drilling new wells and making acquisitions.ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Nevertheless, it’s probably a matter of time before oil and gas executives return to the M&A deal table. Energy expert Energy Intelligence Group has predicted that not only will oil demand grow in 2023 but it will continue doing so till the end of the decade. According to the analyst, global oil demand will grow to 101.2 million barrels per day in the current year and will continue growing to hit 106 mb/d by 2030. Global oil demand will grow by 1.5 mb/d in 2023, with China accounting for 650,000 b/d after the country abandoned its rigorous zero-Covid policy. Indeed, this year’s average will top the previous high of 100.6 mb/d set in 2019. M&A offers Bg Oil the easiest path for production growth when, and if, oil demand grows. While this is great news for the oil bulls, Energy Intelligence says that future demand growth will primarily be driven by petrochemicals rather than transport fuels, and has also said that its base case is a plateau rather than a decline.",NegExxon Is Ramping Up Activity In Offshore Guyana As The Economy Soars.html,"With more than 35 oil discoveries since 2015 the impoverished South American microstate of Guyana has emerged as the world’s hottest frontier drilling location. Global energy supermajor ExxonMobil is leading the charge by exploiting the prolific offshore Stabroek Block where it has discovered over 11 billion barrels of oil resources. Guyana is on-track to become a leading South American oil producer and exporter with production tipped to exceed 1.2 million barrels per day by 2027, making it the world’s 16th largest petroleum producer. This is delivering a tremendous economic bonanza for Georgetown with Guyana now the world’s fastest growing economy. There are fears, however, that Guyana lacks the requisite governance frameworks to effectively manage the massive windfall generated by oil. This leaves the former British colony at risk of being afflicted by the oil curse that left neighboring Venezuela in political and economic chaos. Exxon’s 2015 Liza-1 well in the 6.6-million-acre Stabroek Block, where it is the operator with a 45% working interest with Hess and CNOOC holding 30% and 25% respectively, was the first significant oil discovery in offshore Guyana. Since then, Exxon has reported over 30 discoveries in the block and by April 2023 was pumping nearly 400,000 barrels per day from the Liza oilfield with two floating production storage and offloading vessels. Exxon and partners have three further projects underway in the Stabroek Block with the $12.7 billion 250,000 barrel per day Uaru development the latest to be approved. Exxon plans to start the Payara project during the fourth quarter 2023, with commissioning activities currently underway, which will be the third major offshore development. Payara will have capacity of 220,000 barrels per day, which once achieved will boost Guyana’s total petroleum output to over 600,000 barrels per day giving Georgetown’s oil revenues a healthy boost. Those operations along with the yet to be approved Whiptail project will lift Guyana’s oil output to 1.2 million barrels per day by 2027. Exxon is also proceeding with a relentless drilling campaign in Guyana. During late-April 2023 the supermajor announced a discovery in the Stabroek Block with the Lancetfish-1 well which intersected with 92 feet of oil-bearing sandstone. Nonetheless, the Kokwari-1 wildcat well drilled in the northwest section of the Stabroek Block 37 miles from the Liza-1 well came up dry. Exxon also spudded the Basher-1 and Blackfin-1 exploratory wells during the first quarter 2023. Those form part of a 10 well exploration campaign in the Stabroek Block. During March 2023, Exxon filed an Environmental Impact Assessment with Guyana’s Environmental Protection Agency outlining a 35 well drilling plan for the Stabroek Block. Previous drilling successes make likely that Exxon will report further oil discoveries over the course of 2023 which will boost the volume of recoverable oil resources in the Stabroek Block, which were previously estimated to exceed 11 billion barrels.  Exxon’s oil operations in the Stabroek Block are delivering a tremendous economic and fiscal windfall for Georgetown. The impoverished South America microstate with a population of over 800,000 emerged during 2020 as the world’s fastest growing economy reporting that gross domestic product expanded by a whopping 43.5% that year. Since then, Guyana’s economy has expanded at a stunning rate. For 2021, GDP grew by 20% and then a whopping 62% during 2022 with it predicted the economy will expand by a notable 37% in 2023, making it the fastest growing economy of any sovereign state. Guyana is benefiting from a substantial financial windfall from the massive offshore oil boom despite the disadvantageous contract with the Exxon led consortium which leaves the country exposed to financial and environmental risks. According to Guyana’s central bank, the South American microstate received $53.3 million in royalties and $143.3 million of profits from oil during April 2023. At the end of April 2023, Guyana’s natural resource fund had a balance of $1.67 billion. For 2023, Guyana’s finance minister expects oil income to rise by a notable 31% year over year to $1.63 billion. Those sums will continue to grow as oil production expands and Exxon brings additional FPSOs online. The tremendous revenue from oil flowing into Guyana is being invested in a flurry of infrastructure projects including highways, a deep-water port and a $1.9 billion natural gas to energy project. The deep-water port under construction in Eastern Guyana at the town of Berbice is a key piece of urgently needed energy industry infrastructure. The port is being constructed by CGX Energy, a 78% owned subsidiary of Canadian intermediate oil producer Frontera Energy. On completion in late-2023 the port will significantly expand Guyana’s cargo capacity, including for oil, with the country’s two existing petroleum shipment facilities already operating at capacity with no room for expansion. The port also has the potential to service neighboring Suriname, which is undergoing its own nascent oil boom with it speculated that the impoverished former Dutch colony possess considerable offshore oil potential on par with Guyana. Guyana is among the poorest countries in South America with swathes of the population living in poverty without access to basic public goods such as clean running water and electricity. Petroleum is delivering an economic bonanza which will lift Guyana out of poverty and see it become South America’s wealthiest country, a mantle once held by Venezuela. There are fears this vast oil wealth will spark the endemic corruption as well as economic and political dysfunction which caused Venezuela to virtually implode. In less than two decades, Venezuela’s economy, weighed down by a dictatorial socialist regime that fostered corruption, political chaos and malfeasance, collapsed. Indeed, there was a time when President Hugo Chavez believed the considerable revenue generated by Venezuela’s vast oil wealth would never end. Yet by 2015 Venezuela’s economy was in ruins weighed down by sharply weaker oil prices and a failing oil industry. Whether this will occur in Guyana is yet to be seen, but there are fears already rampant corruption and existing political instability could create ideal conditions for the oil curse to claim another victim.",Neg
