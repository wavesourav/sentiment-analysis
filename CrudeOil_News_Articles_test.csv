Oil Price Predictions Have Become Oddly Polarized.html,"Last month, we reported that energy experts have been growing increasingly bearish on the oil price outlook compared to previous sentiment. Four energy agencies including the IEA and OPEC Secretariat have made their predictions for oil demand growth in 2023, with the only common theme being that all four expect demand to grow compared to 2022, but all are less optimistic than they were a year or so ago. Previously, the OPEC Secretariat was the most optimistic, and had predicted that demand will grow by some 2.3 million barrels per day while the International Energy Agency (IEA) sees demand expanding by 2.0 mb/d. On the lower end of the spectrum, Standard Chartered is the least optimistic, and sees demand growing only 1.3 mb/d while U.S.-based Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects growth to clock in at 1.4 mb/d.


 But these economists are now turning more bullish even as the overall market becomes more bearish. The International Energy Agency (IEA) published its monthly oil balances report on Tuesday May, about a week after similar reports were released by the  Energy Information Administration (EIA) and OPEC Secretariat. Commodity experts at Standard Chartered have created a heatmap of demand forecast changes, including their own, in the latest reports relative to one and three months ago. You will notice that the heatmap provides a positive view of demand, with most estimates for 2023 quarters and the annual average having moved higher over both time periods. Interestingly, the biggest upwards revisions have come from the more bearish agencies namely StanChart and the EIA, while more bullish ones including the IEA and OPEC Secretariat have not changed significantly. In sharp contrast, there’s a disconnect between what energy economists are seeing in the data and what speculative traders are acting on. Oil prices have touched multi-year lows on several occasions over the past two months, with StanChart speculating that the disconnect could be the result of the increasingly top-down and macro-led nature of oil-market sentiment.  Source: Standard Chartered Research Short Sellers Take Over Indeed, short sellers are becoming bolder and threatening to overrun the markets. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March triggered massive capital flight from oil to precious metals as panic spread that this could be the early innings of yet another banking and financial crisis.  According to commodity analysts at Standard Chartered, the SVB collapse led to the fastest-ever move to the short side in oil markets, with speculative short volumes more than six times larger than those after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns in 2008. Money-manager positions across the four main Brent and WTI futures contracts became shorter by a record 228.9 million barrels (mb) in the space of just two weeks. 


 Predictably, oil prices cratered to multi-year lows in a matter of days before mounting a half-hearted rally thanks to the 2nd of April decision of some OPEC+ members to make voluntary output cuts.  Related: Chances Of World Reaching Net-Zero By 2050 Unlikely: Exxon Unfortunately for the bulls, the shorts have now returned with a vengeance.  Last week, StanChart reported that money-manager positions across the four main Brent and WTI futures contracts became shorter by 184.6mb over the previous two weeks, a pace only exceeded by the increase in speculative shorts after the SVB collapse, and at the start of the pandemic.  At this point, it’s not clear whether these sharp swings in the same direction are due to an over-reliance on similar algorithms by traders. And, just like us, StanChart says the excessive bearishness is overdone relative to underlying news flow and fundamental data. Crude oil inventories have fallen below the five-year average for the first time this year. Normally, U.S. inventories and oil prices have a strong inverse relationship, with falling inventories pushing prices higher while rising inventories have the opposite effect. However, large inventory draws over the past couple of weeks have failed to prevent significant price falls. As commodity analysts at Standard Chartered have noted, these dislocations tend to be temporary and come at times when prices are moved primarily by other oil market fundamentals, expectations, broader asset markets and financial flows. In this case, recent optimism regarding OPEC+ production cuts has failed to counter worries about demand linked to a weakening economic backdrop and a hawkish Federal Reserve leading to oil prices remaining range-bound. Further, reports have emerged that Russian crude shipments remain strong despite sanctions and embargoes: Reuters reported April oil loadings from Russia's western ports were on track to reach their highest since 2019 at more than 2.4M bbl/day. Too Bearish As we have pointed out before, it’s hard to find a proper justification for the growing bearishness in the oil markets.

 ADVERTISEMENT According to the International Energy Agency, global oil consumption remains on track to rise by 2M bbl/day this year to an all-time high 101.9M bbl/day. Inventories are gradually tightening and should deplete further as OPEC+ implements new production cuts. Crude oil inventories have fallen below the five-year average for the first time this year. Last week, implied gasoline demand rose by 992 thousand barrels per day (kb/d) w/w to a 15-month high of 9.511mb/d. StanChart has predicted that the OPEC+ cuts will eventually eliminate the surplus that had built up in the global oil markets over the past couple of months. According to the analysts, a large oil surplus started building in late 2022 and spilled over into the first quarter of the current year. The analysts estimate that current oil inventories are 200 million barrels higher than at the start of 2022 and a good 268 million barrels higher than the June 2022 minimum.  However, they are now optimistic that the build over the past two quarters will be gone by November if cuts are maintained all year. In a slightly less bullish scenario, the same will be achieved by the end of the year if the current cuts are reversed around October. This should shore up prices.  Meanwhile, natural gas prices are expected to increase in the latter half of the year as Europe goes on yet another buying spree. Europe has failed to secure enough long-term LNG contracts to offset cut-off Russian gas imports, with Reuters predicting this may prove costly next winter and could sharply tighten the market. The European Union views natural gas as a bridge fuel in the transition to renewable energy, and buyers generally struggle to commit to long-term contracts. This means that Europe might be forced to buy more from the spot markets as it did in 2022, which in turn is likely to push prices up: ""Since the green lobby in Europe has managed to persuade politicians wrongly that hydrogen to a large extent can replace natural gas as an energy carrier by 2030, Europe has become far too reliant on spot and short term purchases of LNG,"" consultant Morten Frisch has told Reuters."
The 2023 Oil Demand Conundrum.html,"In its latest Oil Market Report, the International Energy Agency forecast that global oil demand would hit 102 million barrels daily, driven by China, whose oil demand, according to the IEA, reached 16 million bpd two months ago. According to the IEA, oil demand will grow by a substantial 2.2 million bpd this year.


 A week ago, in its latest Monthly Oil Market Report, OPEC left its global oil demand growth forecast unchanged but revised its expectations of Chinese demand upwards: the cartel now expects it to grow by 800,000 bpd, up from an earlier forecast of 760,000 bpd. Meanwhile, oil prices remain stubbornly low despite this upbeat demand outlook. In fact, prices took a dip on the same day that the IEA released its report, which is unequivocally bullish. Why? Because data coming out of China showed that industrial activity and retail sales growth were weaker in April than forecast. There appears to be a major split between forecasts and actual data, and traders are following the latter, which is affecting oil prices heavily. The problem with that is that if the IEA and OPEC are right, and supply tightens later this year, the shock would be that much more powerful. “World oil demand is forecast to rise by 2.2 mb/d year-on-year in 2023 to an average 102 mb/d, 200 kb/d above last month’s Report,” the IEA wrote in the May edition of its OMR.  Related: Goldman Sachs: Oil Markets To Face Supply Crisis In 2024 “China’s demand recovery continues to surpass expectations, with the country setting an all-time record in March at 16 mb/d,” the agency noted. On the same day, oil prices fell because China’s industrial activity increased by 5.6% in April, when a poll of economists conducted by Reuters had shown expected growth of 10.9%. That 5.6%, by the way, was a solid increase on the March industrial activity growth rate, which stood at 3.9%. According to the hard data, then, China’s industrial activity is gaining speed. According to economists, it is not moving fast enough because we have all gotten used to double-digit growth from China, and anything else is interpreted as weak. “Chinese data on demand appears potentially misleading, with mobility data reflecting a freedom and desire to travel around the Labor Day holiday, but accompanied by weaker manufacturing and industrial activity, and faltering annual GDP growth quarter after quarter following an initial re-opening surge.” The above is a quote from Citi’s head of commodity research, Edward Morse, reinforcing the picture of a China that is recovering from the pandemic more slowly than hoped for.


 Yet at the same time, oil imports are on the rise in that same China that everyone looks to when it comes to oil demand. In fact, this year, China became the world’s largest importer of crude oil, accounting for 22.4% of the global total. In March, China’s oil imports soared by 22.5% from last year to reach the highest since June 2020, Reuters reported in April, even though a month later, the growth slowed down as refinery maintenance season began. It would be eccentric to expect a steady and unwavering oil import growth from China just as it would be eccentric to expect a steady and unwavering economic growth from the global powerhouse. Yet it seems that a lot of people are being eccentric, and that is muting the risk of an oil supply shortage in the eyes of traders. That could be dangerous because it could lead to sharp price surges—sharper than they would be otherwise—should the significance of economic data as opposed to forecasts manage to sink in at some point. The data suggests that the world’s demand for oil is growing. The world’s supply of oil is also growing but at a much lower rate because of both conscious decisions, such as OPEC+’s latest cuts, and outages, such as the ones in Kurdistan and Alberta. China is the single individual driver for oil prices with its demand and everything that can affect it. The IEA has recognized the country’s demand growth, but the oil market prefers to follow forecasters who, for reasons of their own, might present a warped picture of reality. Meanwhile, drilling activity in the United States marked the sharpest decline since June 2020 last week, but nobody registered that because they were too busy awaiting industrial activity data from China so they could sell some more oil. The fact that just because reality does not live up to expectations doesn’t mean it does not matter, might play a bad joke on bears later this year.

 ADVERTISEMENT On the other hand, there is also inflation to consider. With no clear signs of abatement in that department, demand for oil outside China and Asia could remain muted, contributing to a more balanced market and a lower risk of sharp price jumps. Should inflation continue rising in places like the European Union, for instance, demand for oil might even decline, although any decline would be limited because of oil’s vital role in any economy. If demand turns out the way the IEA expects it, however, all those analysts arguing oil could reach $100 per barrel before this year’s end may turn out to have been right."
Oil Inches Down As EIA Confirms Crude Build.html,"Crude oil prices moved lower today, after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported an inventory build of 5 million barrels for the week to May 12. At 467.6 million barrels, the EIA said, crude oil inventories are just a bit below the five-year average for this time of the year.


 A day ago, the American Petroleum Institute estimated an inventory increase of 3.7 million barrels, versus analyst expectations for a draw of about a third of that amount. A week ago, the EIA estimated a build of 3 million barrels for crude oil inventories that followed a weekly draw of 1.3 million barrels for the previous week. In fuels, the EIA reported a mixed picture. Gasoline inventories shed 1.4 million barrels during the reporting period, which compared with a draw of 3.2 million barrels for the previous week. Gasoline production averaged 9.5 million bpd last week, which compared with 9.8 million bpd a week earlier. In middle distillates, the EIA reported an inventory increase of 100,000 barrels for the week to May 12. This compared with a draw of 4.2 million barrels for the previous week.


 Middle distillate production stood at an average 4.9 million barrels daily last week, which compared with 4.6 million barrels daily a week earlier. Oil prices, meanwhile, remain weak despite a global oil demand growth revision by the International Energy Agency, which said earlier this week it expected stronger growth than previously forecast. Any effect that projection may have had on crude oil prices was muted by new data out of China that showed industrial activity and retail sales growing more slowly than analysts had forecast. That was despite other data that showed an 18.9% increase in Chinese refinery throughput last month. ""There has been a lot of concern about China's industrial numbers, but if you look at their actual demand numbers or refinery runs, they're knocking on the door of breaking records,"" a Price Futures Group analyst told Reuters.

Goldman Sachs Oil Markets To Face Supply Crisis In 2024.html,"The oil markets remain highly volatile, but continue to have little forward momentum, with WTI prices resuming their negative trading to move away from the pivotal $71.55 resistance level, pointing to renewed expectations of declines in the upcoming sessions.  According to Standard Chartered, the extreme volatility being witnessed in the oil markets is due to gamma hedging effects, with banks selling oil to manage their side of options as prices fall through the strike prices of oil producers put options and volatility increases. 


 The negative price effect has been exacerbated because the main cliff-face of producer puts currently occupies a narrow price range. While gamma hedging effects do not trigger the initial price fall, they result in a short-term undershoot, further magnified by the closing out of associated less committed speculative longs. But the bulls are not ready to move to the sidelines, yet.  According to Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs, there’s still a path to $100 oil with the oil permabull predicting a supply crunch will help turn the markets around. Goldman’s global head of commodities research Jeff Currie has predicted that oil prices could climb back above $100 a barrel in the current year. “Are we going to run out of spare production capacity? Potentially by 2024, you start to have a serious problem.’’ Last month, GS advised investors to buy energy and mining stocks, saying the two sectors are positioned to benefit from economic growth in China. GS’ commodities strategist has forecast that Brent and WTI crude oil will climb 23% and trade near $100 and $95 per barrel over the next 12 trading months, an outlook that supports their upside view for profits in the energy sector.  Related: Equinor Reopens Gas Field In A Boost For Exports To Europe ""Energy trades at a discounted valuation and remains our preferred cyclical overweight. We also recommend investors own mining stocks, which are levered to China growth through rising metals prices,"" the investment bank stated in a note to clients. There are several reasons why the energy sector could still outperform later in the year despite underperforming in the year-to-date. Here are some. #1. Cheap Valuations Last year, the energy sector turned on the afterburners and managed to top all sectors as the global energy crisis exacerbated by Russia’s war in Ukraine triggered a big oil price rally. The sector has been more subdued in the current year with investors once again flocking to Big Tech and semiconductors. But the surprising finding is that energy stocks remain real cheap, both by absolute and historical standards.


 Indeed, the energy sector is the cheapest of all 11 U.S. market sectors, with a current PE ratio of 5.7. In comparison, the next cheapest sector is Basic Materials with a PE valuation of 11.3 while Financials is third cheapest at a PE value of 12.4 . For some perspective, the S&P 500 average PE ratio currently sits at 22.2. So, we can see that oil and gas stocks remain dirt cheap even after last year’s massive runup, thanks in large part to years of underperformance. Rosenberg has analyzed PE ratios by energy stocks by looking at historical data since 1990 and found that, on average, the sector ranks in just its 27th percentile historically. In contrast, the S&P 500 sits in its 71st percentile despite last year’s deep selloff. #2. Market Deficit Oil prices have only been treading water since the big initial gains from the shock announcement, with concerns regarding global demand and recession risks continuing to weigh down the oil markets. Indeed, oil prices barely budged even after EIA data has shown that U.S. crude stockpiles have been falling while Saudi Arabia will hike its official selling prices for all oil sales to Asian customers starting May. But StanChart has predicted that the OPEC+ cuts will eventually eliminate the surplus that had built up in the global oil markets. According to the analysts, a large oil surplus started building in late 2022 and spilled over into the first quarter of the current year. The analysts estimate that current oil inventories are 200 million barrels higher than at the start of 2022 and a good 268 million barrels higher than the June 2022 minimum.  However, they are now optimistic that the build over the past two quarters will be gone by November if cuts are maintained all year. In a slightly less bullish scenario, the same will be achieved by the end of the year if the current cuts are reversed around October. #3. Healthy Earnings

 ADVERTISEMENT Although earnings for the energy sector are expected to come in lower relative to 2022 earnings, the sector is still expected to perform relatively well. According to FactSet data, the blended net profit margin for the S&P 500 for Q1 2023 is 11.5%, which is above the previous quarter’s net profit margin of 11.3%; above the 5-year average of 11.4%, but below the year-ago net profit margin of 12.2%. At the sector level, only three sectors are reporting (or have reported) a year-over-year increase in their net profit margins in Q1 2023 compared to Q1 2022, led by Energy (to 12.4% vs. 10.4%) and Consumer Discretionary (6.6% vs. 4.7%) sectors. With more than 90% of S&P 500 companies having returned their quarterly scorecards, the Energy sector (+7.9%) has reported the fourth-largest positive (aggregate) difference between actual earnings and estimated earnings. Within this sector, EQT Corporation ($1.70 vs. $1.30), Coterra Energy ($0.87 vs. $0.70), Williams Companies ($0.56 vs. $0.47), and Phillips 66 ($4.21 vs. $3.56) reported the largest positive EPS surprises. Overall, there are 11,038 ratings on stocks in the S&P 500. Of these 11,038 ratings, 54.2% are Buy ratings, 39.9% are Hold ratings, and 5.8% are Sell ratings. At the sector level, the Energy (63%) and Communication Services (61%) sectors have the highest percentages of Buy ratings, while the Consumer Staples (45%) sector has the lowest percentage of Buy ratings."
Despite Bullish Signs Traders Shun Oil.html,"Earlier this week, oil reversed a four-week losing streak pushed higher by production shut-ins in Canada and analyst expectations that the tightness of supply is about to manifest itself during peak demand season. Yet traders have been selling oil and fuels these past weeks, and they might need more time to stop. Since April 18, hedge funds and similar entities have sold the equivalent of 249 million barrels of crude, Reuters' market analyst John Kemp reported in his column this week. The amount represents half of their previous positions in oil.


 It's hard not to see the reason for the selloff: there has been so much being reported about a looming recession in the United States. Even if things don't get as bad as a full-blown recession, inflation remains a substantial problem with a potential negative impact on prices. Yet, as Kemp notes, prices have now dropped below their long-term average for this time of the year. This would normally suggest it's time for a correction and position traders at the ready-steady-go line. Yet it hasn't. Few seem to believe oil is going to start climbing again in the coming weeks. Analysts expect it though a bit further out, in the second half of the year. Dutch ING commodity analysts, for example, recently forecasted a much tighter oil supply situation in the second half of the year driven by growing demand from non-OECD countries and a smaller-than-expected increase in U.S. production. Morningstar energy strategist Stephen Ellis said recently that the time may have come to buy the dip. ""We have near-term surpluses for the first half of 2023, but we expect Chinese demand to come back up and pinch demand a bit,"" Ellis said. Goldman Sachs' Jeffrey Currie is of a similar opinion. Speaking on the sidelines of an event in Saudi Arabia this weekend, Currie also noted demand pick-up from China but also mentioned spare production capacity. According to him, this could dwindle by next year enough to send oil prices back into three-digit territory.  Related: Saudi Aramco Considers Another Stock Offering In Riyadh Of course, Currie also said that sanctions would reduce Russian oil exports, and this has not really started to happen yet, contrary to most predictions, so there is always a bit of uncertainty remaining. In this case, it is quite a lot of uncertainty because of the size of Russia's exports. Based on the current sentiment in oil trading circles and the cautious approach they are displaying, one could suggest that the market would need something even bigger than the more than 300,000 bpd in shut-in Canadian output to rekindle interest in oil buying.


 Perhaps a flare-up in regional tensions as Iran seizes a third foreign tanker and the U.S. ramps up its military presence in the Persian Gulf could do the job. It hasn't yet, possibly because the third tanker was actually Iranian, and Iran said it was reclaiming it after a foreign seizure, but it might yet do the trick. OPEC+, meanwhile, remains one of the main factors to consider... and it doesn't seem to be planning more output cuts. On the face of it, that could seem bearish if one assumes the only point of the latest cuts was to push prices higher. But reservations about further cuts might point in another direction. It might mean that as peak season begins, OPEC+ would expect the rise in demand to do the job for prices. That rise might never materialize, however, as Cit's Ed Morse recently noted in comments about the immediate future of oil prices. What's some more uncertainty when it comes to oil, after all? ""We foresee neither a turning point in demand growth to the upside nor to inadequate supply from non-OPEC. If anything, the chances are that demand will continue to underperform expectations through the year just as demand has disappointed globally year-to-date,"" Morse said, as quoted by Livewire Markets.

Underhedged Oil Producers Heavily Exposed To Low Oil Prices.html,"Hedging is a popular trading strategy frequently used by oil and gas producers, airlines and other heavy consumers of energy commodities to protect themselves against market fluctuations. During times of falling crude prices, oil producers normally use a short hedge to lock in oil prices if they believe prices are likely to go even lower in the future.  Last year, with oil and gas prices hitting multi-year highs, producers that typically lock up prices preferred to hedge only lightly, or not at all, to avoid leaving money on the table if crude continued to soar.


 But oil and gas prices have retreated significantly since peaking mid-2022, leaving producers with minimal hedging exposed to highly volatile energy markets. Back in November, Standard Chartered reported that the U.S. oil hedge book was less than a fifth of the Q1-2020 peak of 563mb. Now the commodity traders have provided an update and revealed that producers are still showing little appetite for this type of insurance despite wild swings in oil prices. StanChart has revealed that there has been no significant rebound in oil hedging by U.S. producers over the past three months with the hedge book standing at 363 million barrels (mb) at the start of May, a mere 1.5% higher than the February estimate and the lowest across the 30 quarters of its panel survey. Meanwhile, hedge ratios remain low with the 2023 figure at 21.2%, while the ratio for 2024 output is just 5.2%. Gas producers have been more cautious with equivalent ratios for natural gas output at 43.2% for 2023 and 22.5% for 2024, perfectly understandable considering the huge gas price crash. The experts have reported that the distribution of 2023 purchased put options held by producers is mostly clustered almost exactly in the middle of the key USD 68-72/bbl range, suggesting that gamma effects are likely to intensify the next significant move above or below that range. About a month ago, Standard Chartered reported  that the extreme volatility being witnessed in the oil markets is due to gamma hedging effects, with banks selling oil to manage their side of options as prices fall through the strike prices of oil producers put options and volatility increases. The negative price effect has been exacerbated because the main cliff-face of producer puts currently occupies a narrow price range. While gamma hedging effects do not trigger the initial price fall, they result in a short-term undershoot, further magnified by the closing out of associated less committed speculative longs.   Related: WTO Chief: Nigeria Can’t Rely On Oil & Gas Revenues The Best Hedge: A Strong Balance Sheet Buoyed by the best financial performance in years, oil executives are wagering that high oil and gas prices are here to stay, with less hedging activity reflecting this optimism. As Paul Cheng, an analyst at Scotiabank, has told Bloomberg, the best hedge for oil and gas companies is a strong balance sheet. “Management teams have greater FOMO, or fear of missing out, being hedged in a runaway market. With prices rising and companies’ books stronger than they’ve been in years, many drillers are opting out of their usual hedging activity”, Cheng told Bloomberg.   Likewise, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Tran told Bloomberg, “Fortified corporate balance sheets, reduced debt burdens and the most constructive market outlook in years has sapped producer hedging programs.” Some Big Oil companies are so confident that high oil prices are here to stay that they have completely ditched their hedges.


 To wit, Pioneer Natural Resources Co .(NYSE: PXD), the biggest oil producer in the Permian Basin, closed out almost all of its hedges for 2022 in a  bid to capture any run-up in prices while shale producer Antero Resources Corp.(NYSE: AR) revealed that it’s the “least hedged” in the company’s history. Meanwhile, Devon Energy Corp. (NYSE: DVN) is only about 20% hedged, way lower than the company’s ~50% normally. Interestingly, some oil companies are being egged on by investors looking for more commodity exposure. “It has been overwhelmingly the request of our investors. We have a stronger balance sheet than we’ve ever had, and we have more and more investors that want exposure to the commodity price,” Devon Chief Executive Officer Rick Muncrief told Bloomberg News when asked about the decision to hedge less.  But the experts are now saying that the current trend of not hedging future output could have major implications up and down the forward price curve--in a good way. That’s the case because energy producers act as natural sellers in futures contracts some 12 to 18 months ahead. Without them, trading in later months has less liquidity and fewer checks, leading to more volatility and potentially even bigger rallies. In turn, higher oil prices in the future are likely to encourage producers to invest more in drilling projects, a trend that has slowed down considerably thanks in large part to the clean energy transition. Double-edged sword Other than avoiding leaving money on the table, there’s another good reason why producers have been hedging less--avoiding potentially huge losses. Hedging is broadly meant to protect against a sudden collapse in prices. Many producer hedges are set up by selling a call option above the market, a so-called three-way collar structure. These options tend to be a relatively cheap way to hedge against price fluctuations as long as prices remain range bound. Indeed, collars are essentially costless.

 ADVERTISEMENT In theory, hedging allows producers to lock-in a certain price for their oil. The simplest way to do this is by buying a floor on the price using a put option then offsetting this cost by selling a ceiling using a call option. To trim costs even further, producers can sell what is commonly referred to as a subfloor, which is essentially a put option much lower than current oil prices. This is the three-way collar hedging strategy. Three-way collars tend to work well when oil prices are moving sideways; however, they can leave traders exposed when prices fall too much. Indeed, this strategy fell out of favor during the last oil crash of 2014 when prices fell too low leaving shale producers counting heavy losses. But exiting hedging positions can also be costly. Indeed, U.S. shale producers suffered tens of  billions in hedging losses in 2022, with  EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG) losing $2.8 billion in a single quarter while Hess Corp. (NYSE: HES) and Pioneer paid $325M apiece to exit their hedging positions. Whether or not this dramatic cut in hedging activity will come back to bite U.S. producers remains to be seen."
OPEC Cut Failed To Lift Oil Prices But The Year Isnt Over Yet.html,"Crude oil prices have been on a losing streak for four consecutive weeks now, erasing all the gains they booked after OPEC’s latest supply cut announcement as economic fears take precedence over demand expectations. When the cartel announced the cuts, almost every bank with a commodities department rushed to update their price forecasts, expecting prices to jump even higher than before. Morgan Stanley was a rare exception: it revised its price forecast for oil downwards.


 “OPEC probably needs to do this to stand still,” Martijn Rats, chief commodity strategist at the investment bank, said at the time, adding that the OPECc+ decision “reveals something, it gives a signal of where we are in the oil market. And look, let’s be honest about this, when demand is roaring…then OPEC doesn’t need to cut.” He seems to have been right, for the most part. Only it’s not demand itself that was the problem. It has been the popular expectation of worsening demand that has been driving the price decline. Indeed, the daily media updates on oil prices have, in the past four weeks, repeated the same refrain over and over again: weak U.S. and Chinese economic data, fears of more interest rate hikes in the U.S., fears of a recession, which is already a fact in certain industries, notably freight transport.  Related: U.S. Gasoline Prices Are Set For A Significant Decline  Clearly, these expectations have had a sound basis. The thing about oil demand, however, is that the U.S., or the rest of the developed world, is not where additional oil demand will be coming from in the rest of the year and future years. It’s the developing world that will see growth in oil demand with the potential to drive prices higher. Dutch ING said in a recent oil market update that while oil prices remain depressed for now, things could very well change in the second part of the year, with a deficit looming on the horizon.  The basis for this forecast is a combination of lower OPEC+ output, higher demand outside the OECD, and a smaller-than-expected growth in U.S. output, according to ING. What’s more, there is always the possibility that OPEC+ will cut output again, adding to oil’s upside potential. The Dutch financial services major is not the only one expecting higher prices later this year. Citi’s commodities head Ed Morse recently told CNBC that oil prices may have bottomed out, and we’re entering peak demand season in the much more populated northern hemisphere. “OPEC+ output cuts and a rebound in China’s demand will likely offset slower demand elsewhere ... Therefore, we expect prices to bottom out soon,” the Commonwealth Bank of Australia said in a note from early May.


 Goldman is another bank that’s optimistic about the immediate future of oil prices. In a note from early March—weeks before the surprise OPEC+ cut announcement, the bank said Brent could reach $100 by the end of the year if OPEC keeps its 2-million-barrel output cut agreement in place. Again, that was before the OPEC+ additional cut announcement that temporarily boosted prices. And it might well boost them once again as the year progresses. All it would take would be a more optimistic economic update from either China or the United States. Of course, all these are only projections based on historical data and some common sense. The thing about markets, however, is that they do not always obey common sense but tend to get swayed on a dime. The past four weeks are evidence of that, with oil traders largely ignoring any fundamentals to focus on what banks call the macro picture. They have ignored data about Chinese refinery throughputs and oil imports to focus on the latest PMI, which has shown a contraction in the country’s growth pace. They have ignored data about U.S. production trends to focus on the April CPI reading, which showed inflation remains a substantial problem. All this is perfectly understandable: the so-called macro picture has a huge bearing on oil demand, which tends to decline in times of high inflation and rising interest rates. The thing that gets forgotten, however, while watching that macro picture is that oil, for all its bad rap, is what economists call an inelastic commodity.
ADVERTISEMENT



 ADVERTISEMENT This means that whatever the price for the commodity, there will always be strong demand for it. And this, in turn, means that it might be time for traders to focus a bit more on the supply outlook. Because when supply tightens, prices will rise—demand will be going nowhere, even in inflation-stricken U.S. What’s more, as ING noted in its oil market update, OPEC+ is aware of the power it can wield in output control. There is nothing to prevent it from doing it again should prices fall too low for its liking. After all, how much market share can it lose?"
The Energy Transition Has A Metals Problem.html,"Copper prices this week fell to the lowest since last November on weak economic data from China. Yet the International Copper Study Group, a group of copper exporters and importers, just said it expected a deficit of the metal this year.  Others, such as commodity giant Trafigura, are sounding the alarm for long-term shortages, too, expecting record prices for the metal, without which the energy transition would be impossible. Yet prices remain weak. And this is a big problem.


 Wind and solar installations require between eight and 12 times more copper than coal and gas generation capacity, according to the International Bar Association. EVs notoriously require three to four times more of the basic metal than internal combustion engine vehicles. A transition to net zero would thus require much more copper than we are producing now on a global scale. According to S&P Global, demand for copper will double by 2035. According to McKinsey, by 2031, the world will face a gap of more than 6 million tons annually between the demand for copper and its supply.  The ICSG said earlier this year that only two new copper mines were brought online between 2017 and 2021. It also said that copper output last year increased by a lot less than it expected, and the same is true for this year. Something is not quite right with copper. And copper is just one of the dozen or more metals of which we would need more if we are going to hit net-zero targets. These begin to seem extremely elusive in the context of the latest trends in the mining industry. One of these—perhaps the most worrying—is that it would now take 23 years for a mine to go from the discovery of copper to the start of actual industrial production. That’s more than the time the UK and California have set themselves to become all-electrified in the passenger transport department. And it means there will not be enough copper for all the EVs they eye by 2035.  Related: European Natural Gas Prices Are Set For A Sixth Consecutive Weekly Loss Just months ago, miners were talking about a decade from discovery to production, but with more stringent environmental regulations in mineral-rich developed countries and fast-evolving regulation in developing countries, this is where the industry is at: 23 years, according to data from consultancy Airguide, as reported by Reuters’ Clyde Russell. The numbers, interestingly, were reported at a mining industry conference where attendants failed to find anything nice to say about permitting regimes in most mineral-rich jurisdictions, too. The U.S. administration has been promising faster mine permitting, but even if it lives up to that promise, there are activists to consider, too—activists who might like wind and solar, but seem to like nature as it is more. And who have proved they can stop new mining developments.


 What’s more, activism of this sort is evolving, and now commentators have coined a new term to replace the widespread not-in-my-back-yard sentiment among both activists and regular taxpayers. Instead of NIMBY, they are now talking about BANANA, or Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anybody. These people, Russell says in his report, are, for the mining industry, the same people who are the loudest proponents of the energy transition. And they are effectively the people who are hard at work to make that transition impossible. These somewhat ironic challenges come on top of more fundamental ones, such as falling ore grades and a significant drop in the number of new discoveries. The dynamics within the industry have changed, too, Russell notes in his report on the Mining Investment Asia summit. Before, junior miners discovered a resource, proved it and then either raised more money to develop it or passed the baton to one of the big players. Now, junior miners are suffering a shortage of project leaders, and large miners are reluctant to invest in new discoveries. Because prices do not reflect the fundamentals of copper. Perhaps it is only a matter of time for them to start reflecting these fundamentals rather than following economic reports coming out of China. Indeed, copper is in a special position as a bellwether metal, its price widely taken to indicate the direction any economy is taking. Weak copper prices normally reflect weaker economic growth and vice versa. Yet the crucial role of copper in the energy transition should have added a vector in price-setting. It should have, but it hasn’t, and this is keeping copper prices low and funding harder to come by for junior miners on which that crucial future supply of copper depends.

 ADVERTISEMENT “Governments could work to speed up approvals once they recognise the need for expanded mineral production, but history suggests government action really only happens when the point of crisis is already reached,” Reuters’ Russell wrote in his report. Indeed, governments are not the fastest to act unless things are really bad, as we saw last year in the EU. But this time, governments are spearheading the surge in metals and minerals demand. They are genuinely talking about encouraging more mining activity. But even they probably know what gap exists between talk and action. The BANANAs are lurking around, ready to stage a protest against any new mine that threatens a rare and endangered species. And that’s because a lot of people want an energy transition but without all the mining necessary to enable it. They want to have the cake and eat it too. Sadly, as history has proven time and again, this is outside the realm of the possible."
450000 Bpd Flow Of Kurdish Crude Unlikely To Restart This Weekend.html,"While the Iraqi oil minister has said that 450,000 barrels per day of shut-in oil exports from Iraqi Kurdistan would restart exports on Saturday, Kurdish and Turkish officials both said on Friday that it is unlikely the pipeline would be turned back on in that timeframe. The pipeline was closed down on March 25 by Turkey, following an international arbitration ruling in favor of Iraq against Turkey. The pipeline shut-down removed Kurdish oil from the market that it was exporting unilaterally to Turkey, against the wishes of the Iraqi federal government.  On Thursday, Iraqi and KRG officials said they had submitted a request on Wednesday for Turkey to restart the pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan, which delivers oil from the Kurdistan Region of Iraq to markets. 


 The Iraqi oil minister said the request was for Turkey to restart the pipeline on Saturday, suggesting that the request would be accepted immediately. Kurdish officials had been more circumspect, noting to the media that Ankara had not yet responded to the request at the time.  While the Iraqi federal government and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) have agreed to a deal to allow the oil to be exported again, Turkey will have the final say as it controls the pipeline at the port of Ceyhan.  Under the new deal between Baghdad and the KRG, the Iraqi federal oil marketing agency, SOMO, will sell Kurdish oil going forward, with revenues going into a bank account controlled by the Kurds. Kurdish officials maintain that all contracts with oil traders will belong to Erbil, while the oil will be exported through SOMO.  “It is the same contract and with the same companies, but with the prices of SOMO,” Kurdistan Region Electricity Minister Kamal Mohammed, acting as the Minister of Natural Resources, told Rudaw. Turkey, in the meantime, is preparing for a critical election on May 14, and Turkish officials have previously indicated that they might hold off on restarting the KRG oil pipeline as they further negotiate the $1.5-billion arbitration settlement with Iraq.

Low Quality Crude Sees Mysterious Price Rally.html,"Middle Eastern oil producers are raising the export prices for their lower-grade crudes, Bloomberg reported earlier this week. And European buyers have no choice but to pay up—because the alternative is Russian oil, and they can’t have that. It is a curious case, as noted in another Bloomberg report on the issue, since normally, the lower the crude grade, the lower the price. Light, sweet crudes like WTI or Arab Super Light fetch higher prices from refiners because they are easier to process into fuels.


 Heavier crudes and crudes with higher sulfur content—sour crudes—are normally cheaper because their refining is a more complicated affair. Yet the refining business doesn’t follow this unshakeable logic. Refineries are calibrated to operate with certain types of oil, and a lot of European refineries were calibrated to operate with Russian Urals—a medium sour grade. Energy Intelligence sounded the alarm as early as last year in an article that noted that European refineries had for decades processed Urals and would have a hard time replacing it with similar crudes. Global markets were amply supplied with light sweet crudes, the report pointed out, but the supply of medium sour ones was tighter. A year later, it still is, according to the Bloomberg reports. And producers are responding the way sellers always respond when demand for their product surges. Iraq has raised the price of its Basrah Medium for European buyers to the highest in a year. Saudi Arabia also raised the price of its Arab Light, which is in fact a medium sour crude.  Related: Trump Promises To ""Drill, Baby, Drill"" If Elected At the same time, in what would probably seem like a cruel move to Europeans, both Iraq and Saudi Arabia kept their prices unchanged for Asian buyers—who, to be fair, normally buy a lot more oil than European refiners, and now they’re also gobbling up Russian barrels, making it unwise for the Iraqis and the Saudis to raise prices to them. In addition to the replacement game that’s going on in international oil, there is also another factor: new refineries are coming on stream in the Middle East, so local consumption of various crudes is on the rise, leaving more limited volumes for export, as Bloomberg noted in a report that said the price changes in medium sour were taking traders by surprise. Some relief for European refiners came from the U.S., whose oil exports to Europe were set to reach a record in March at around 2 million barrels daily, but the fact is that U.S. oil production consists mostly of light, sweet crudes that can’t replace Urals at European refineries.


 They can’t replace heavy crudes for U.S. refineries, either, hence the United States’ continued dependence on imports of oil even after it became the world’s largest producer of the commodity. This means that the market of medium sour crude grades is set for an extended period of tight supply. Until some producers decide to boost output, but they have little motivation to do it, what with the EU’s and the UK’s plans for phasing out fossil fuel consumption. With such a context for future demand, producers are unlikely to invest in a production boost. This, in turn, means fuels will be more expensive for Europeans, and that would add fuel to already high inflation. A decline in benchmark oil prices would be a welcome respite but only a temporary one. Until refiners depend on imported sour crude from producer countries that make most of their money from their oil exports, they would be made to pay as much as the producers see fit. India and China, meanwhile, have access to discount Russian crude—all grades—and also cheap Middle Eastern crude, benefiting from both Europe’s questionable international policies and from internal competition in OPEC+. The EU might want to hurry up with replacing GDP with something else before the differences between its own GDP and China’s and India’s become too glaring.

OPEC World Oil Demand To Rise By 233 Million Bpd In 2023.html,"For the third month running, OPEC has barely changed its forecast of global oil demand, predicting growth of 2.33 million barrels per day, or 2.3% Y/Y growth, good for a very slight increase from its previous forecast of 2.32 million barrels per day. According to OPEC, strong growth in the Chinese market of 800,000 b/d is likely to be offset by downside risks elsewhere such as the U.S. debt ceiling. ""Minor upward adjustments were made due to the better than expected performance in China's economy, while other regions are expected to see slight declines due to economic challenges that are likely to weigh on oil demand,"" OPEC said in the report.


 Over the past year, energy agencies have generally grown more bearish with their forecasts on oil demand growth. The EIA’s latest growth prediction of a decline of 420,000 barrels per day (kb/d) in what experts refer to as the call on OPEC (i.e. global demand minus non-OPEC supply) in the current year, a level 1.87 million barrels per day (mb/d) lower than its July 2022 forecast.  Other agencies expect lackluster growth: Standard Chartered sees “the call” growing by just 63,000 b/d, 1.41mb/d less than its July 2022 forecast, while the International Energy Agency (IEA) expects growth of 400kb/d, 2.326mb/d below its July 2022 forecast.  The upshot of it all is that all four agencies at least expect some growth, though they can’t seem to come close to finding consensus on the magnitude. At least one expert has predicted that oil demand will hit an all-time high in the current year. Commodity experts at StanChart have predicted that global oil demand will set a new all-time high of 102.24mb/d in August, surpassing the previous record of 102.2mb/d set in August 2019.


 The bullish interpretation simply is that this is an all-time high; the bearish one is that it has taken no less than four years for global demand just to get back to the previous high. Indeed, StanChart reckons that had it been business-as-usual during those four years, global oil demand would have increased by another 5mb/d. Even better, StanChart sees oil demand setting fresh all-time highs in both November and December with demand set to rise above 103mb/d for the first time in June 2024."
Shale Steals The Show As Oil Gas Spending Surges.html,"Global energy reliability concerns are triggering a surge in oil and gas investments – but this uptick is only temporary, and service companies should capitalize now before the focus returns to the energy transition. After Russia invaded Ukraine, expected investments in fossil fuels in 2022 and 2023 surged by $140 billion, Rystad Energy research shows. Before the war, the two-year total was projected at $945 billion, but as the war sparked shortages and sky-high prices, expected spending has jumped to almost $1.1 trillion. Of the $140 billion growth, shale production attracted most of the limelight with an additional $80 billion increase, as activity climbed 30% and pricing for oilfield services jumped nearly 50%. Offshore production accounted for $40 billion in growth, while other onshore activities expanded by an additional $20 billion.


 “Service companies should make the most of this upturn now, while keeping one eye firmly on the future. The energy transition is not slowing down; huge waves of investments in renewables and clean tech are on the horizon. So, to ensure their long-term success, service companies should adapt their offerings now to capitalize fully on the inevitable green revolution,” says Audun Martinsen, head of supply chain research at Rystad Energy.  Last year’s sudden need for more upstream activity through more rigs, more completed wells, and more greenfield sanctioning was so strong that the oilfield service supply chain could not meet the record demand for services and equipment that emerged in shale, offshore and conventional markets. As a result, service prices rose, and more than half of the additional spending so far has ended up as a five percentage-point increase in suppliers’ profit margins rather than as more activity. Energy security concerns have unlocked significant additional investments in oil and gas, boosting spending forecasts and sending the expected timing for peak oil demand out in time. The first wave of extra spending over the past 15 months mainly went to oil and gas, while low-carbon industries faced a slowdown due to high inflation and shortages in the supply chain. But low-carbon spending will bounce back, as energy security is not only about securing oil and gas here and now but also about securing cleaner energy for the future. The US Inflation Reduction Act and the recently announced Critical Raw Mineral and Technology Acts in the European Union will strengthen the significant investment cycle brewing in the renewable and clean-tech sectors. Solar, wind, carbon capture, hydrogen, and batteries are all markets that will benefit from supportive policies to accelerate low-carbon deployment and build up local supply chains.


 “Gaining control of the supply chain is crucial for countries and regions to become less dependent on global value chains. Even though the sun shines and the wind blows in every country, the energy must still be harnessed and stored locally. This can only be done with a reliable, often local, supply chain,” says Martinsen. "
Traders Dump Oil As Concerns About The Economy Persist.html,"Money managers fled the oil market in the week to May 2, reversing two weeks of buying petroleum futures and contracts spurred by the new production cuts announced by several large OPEC+ members in early April. A month after the OPEC+ group surprised the oil market by announcing additional cuts to production between May and December 2023 to ensure the “stability of the market,” oil prices are where they were just before the announcement, in the mid-$70s per barrel Brent. 


 The initial euphoria from an expected additional market tightening gave way to renewed concerns about the macroeconomic backdrop with a recession looming. Continued concerns about the banking sector did not help the bullish narrative either.  So hedge funds and other money managers cut their bullish bets in the most traded petroleum futures and options contracts for a second consecutive week in the week to May 2, reversing the more bullish positions they had amassed in the two weeks after OPEC+ announced the latest production cuts.  WTI Crude, the U.S. benchmark, saw the biggest drop in the net long position – the difference between bullish and bearish bets – in six weeks in the week to May 2, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) showed.     In the petroleum complex, including WTI, Brent, European gasoil, U.S. diesel, and U.S. gasoline, the ratio of bullish to bearish bets slumped to just 2.22 to 1 as of May 2, Reuters’ senior market analyst John Kemp notes, as traders slashed longs and added shorts.  Related: Texas Natural Gas Prices Turn Negative  To compare, the longs-to-shorts ratio was 5 to 1 in the middle of April when traders were buying crude and many short sellers were caught off-guard by the OPEC+ cuts. Back in early April, a massive short covering and a renewed buying spree in oil futures followed in the two days after OPEC+ said it would keep another more than 1 million bpd off the market for the rest of the year.  In the latest reporting week to May 2, money managers cut their long positions and added short positions, thus reducing their net bullish bets in both WTI Crude and Brent Crude futures and options contracts. Brent, WTI, and European gasoil – the proxy for diesel – were the hardest hit by selling.  


 The traders’ positioning in the benchmark U.S. and European diesel futures even showed a net short position, one in which bearish bets outnumber bullish ones. The net short position in ICE gasoil futures continued to swell to a fresh high in more than seven years, suggesting that traders are increasingly concerned about future diesel demand and expect a recession.  In the previous reporting week to April 25, selling in distillates had accelerated and ICE gasoil flipped to a net short for only the third time in seven years, while the net long in ULSD – the benchmark diesel futures for fuel delivered into New York Harbor – was slashed by 44% to a 27-month low.    In the U.S., signs have emerged in recent weeks that U.S. diesel demand and prices have weakened this year as freight and industrial activities have slowed amid higher interest rates and falling consumer demand for goods. Some refiners are already seeing a drag on diesel demand caused by the sticky inflation, while transportation and logistics firms say a “freight recession” is already happening, and smaller trucking companies are folding up.  Speculators have been consistently caught off-guard in the past two months, and many have now opted to stay away. Lower open interest and liquidity in the market is bound to make price swings even more extreme, according to analysts.

Oil Falls Further On EIA Inventory Report.html,"Crude oil prices fell further today after the Energy Information Administration reported an inventory build of 3 million barrels for the week to May 5. This compared with an inventory draw of 1.3 million barrels estimated for the previous week.


 A day before the EIA released its latest figures, the American Petroleum Institute reported a build in inventories of 3.62 million barrels contrary to expectations of another draw, pressuring prices. At 462.6 million barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories are 1% below the five-year average for this time of the year. The EIA also reported hefty draws in fuel inventories for the week to May 5. Gasoline inventories shed 3.2 million barrels in the period, with production averaging 9.8 million barrels daily. This compared with an inventory build of 1.7 million barrels and a production rate of 9.4 million barrels daily for the previous week. In middle distillates, the authority estimated an inventory decline of 4.2 million barrels and average production of 4.6 million barrels daily.


 This compared with an inventory draw of 1.2 million barrels and a production rate of 4.6 million barrels daily. A slowdown in both gasoline and diesel demand has fueled concern about future oil demand in the world’s largest economy although the slowdown in diesel demand has quenched concerns about a possible shortage. Refineries processed 15.7 million barrels daily in the week to May 5, unchanged on a week earlier. Prices, meanwhile, remained subdued until the release of the latest consumer price figures for the U.S. After the release of the latest monthly CPI, oil trended lower still, as the data showed inflation had remained stubbornly high although it fell by 0.4% on a monthly basis.

Russias Crude Oil Shipments Hit Highest Since At Least Early 2022.html,"Russia’s crude oil exports by sea hit a new high of 3.55 million barrels per day (bpd) in the four weeks to May 5, the highest shipments since at least early 2022, tanker-tracking data monitored by Bloomberg showed on Tuesday. Russian crude shipments have continued to rise over the past four weeks, according to the data reported by Bloomberg’s Julian Lee, despite Russia’s insistence that it is cutting oil production by 500,000 bpd and even more.


 Russia warned in February that it would cut its crude oil production by 500,000 bpd due to EU import bans and price caps on its crude oil and oil products. Initially, Russia said this lowered production would apply to March. But Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak announced part way through March that the cuts would be extended. Those 500,000 bpd cuts will now extend until the end of 2023, but crude oil export data in recent weeks do not reflect any cuts—on the contrary, Russian crude oil exports by sea are rising. On a four-week average basis, Russian crude oil shipments to May 5 rose by 180,000 bpd to 3.63 million bpd, also the highest since Bloomberg started to closely track vessels departing from Russia’s oil export terminals at the beginning of 2022. Volumes headed to China and India in the past four weeks were also at a record, considering that nearly all Russian exports are now headed to the two biggest Asian importers and other destinations in Asia flashed as “unknown” on vessel data. The four-week average crude oil exports from Russia to Asia and “unknown destinations” increased by 124,000 bpd in the four weeks to May 5, compared to the four-week average for the period to April 28, according to the data compiled by Bloomberg.


 The main destinations of Russian crude oil shipments continue to be China, India, and Turkey, while the cargoes currently labeled as headed to an “unknown destination” eventually end up in one of those three countries."
US Oil Production On Track To Hit A Record High This Year.html,"One of my 2023 energy predictions was “Total U.S. oil production will again rise, and set a new annual production record.” The previous annual record was set in 2019 at 12.3 million barrels per day (bpd), and by the end of 2022 monthly production was just about back to that level following the devasting Covid-19 impact on the industry in 2020. Of course, we don’t yet know if oil production will continue to creep higher, or whether falling prices will finally impact production. As I indicated when I made the prediction, I felt like it was a coin flip on whether we would reach a new annual record, but I leaned toward the affirmative.


 A third of the year is now behind us, so let’s check in on this prediction. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) presently shows monthly production for January and February only. For those two months, oil production was 12.5 million bpd, a significant increase from December 2022’s level of 12.1 million bpd. For March and April, we have to estimate the production rate based on the EIA’s weekly Petroleum Status Report (PSR). According to the U.S. Petroleum Balance Sheet for the Week Ending 3/31/2023, the four-week average oil production for March was 12.2 million bpd. That’s a good estimate for March. Through three weeks of April, the production rate had risen slightly to 12.25 million bpd. Final April numbers may vary a bit from this, but it’s close enough to give us an estimate for the first third of the year. Averaging the monthly numbers for January through April gives an average year-to-date production of 12.37 million bpd. That will slightly eclipse the 2019 record if that rate holds for the rest of the year. It will be close, but as I said previously it’s a coin toss. The most recent EIA projections are that U.S. crude oil production is expected to increase to new records in 2023 and 2024. The EIA forecasts that U.S. crude oil production will average 12.4 million bpd in 2023 and 12.8 million bpd in 2024. The main drivers of this growth are expected to be increased production in the Permian region and the Federal Offshore Gulf of Mexico.


 In conclusion, the first third of 2023 has shown promising signs for U.S. oil production, with the potential to surpass the previous annual record set in 2019. While it remains a close call, the EIA’s projections for 2023 and 2024 agree that the industry is on track to achieve new records in the coming years. This growth will undoubtedly help blunt the influence of OPEC and Russia on the U.S. economy and energy landscape."
OPECs April Production Falls Survey.html,"  Julianne Geiger


 OPEC’s crude oil production fell last month to a level not seen in nearly a year, a Bloomberg survey showed on Tuesday. OPEC’s crude oil production fell 310,000 barrels per day in April to just 28.8 million bpd, the survey said. The group had said at the end of March that it would cut production by another 1.6 million bpd starting in May, but much of April’s small decrease came in the form of unintentional production cuts, with Iraq’s decreased production for the month accounting for about 80% of the group’s total production losses. Iraq saw its crude oil production decline 250,000 bpd to 4.13 million bpd over a pipeline shutdown that runs from Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdistan region to Turkey. That pipeline is responsible for carrying about half a million barrels per day. Iraq’s production is at the lowest level since late 2021. Nigeria saw its production increase by 3.5% in February before sinking 2% in March to 1.517 million bpd. In April, Bloomberg’s survey showed a dip of 120,000 bpd to 1.32 million bpd, partly due to the striking of ExxonMobil workers in the country. Nigeria’s Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission had been confident that its production would continue to increase, eyeing full-year production of 1.69 million bpd as part of its long-term plan to increase production and grow its proven oil reserves to 50 billion barrels. Nigeria’s production target for March was 1.8 million bpd.


 OPEC+ members Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Iraq, Algeria, Oman, Gabon, and Kazakhstan make up the ones that agreed to cut more production beginning this month. OPEC+ is set to meet next on June 4, when it will discuss production levels for July 2023 and beyond."
India Leads In Russian Oil Laundering To Europe.html,"A new report by the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) has found that European countries that banned Russian oil imports are instead importing huge amounts of oil commodities from India, China, United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Turkey, therefore qualifying them as laundromats.  The report, titled Laundromat: How the price cap coalition whitewashes Russian oil in third countries, reveals that western countries bought $42 billion worth of laundered Russian crude in the form of various oil products from nations that are friendly towards Russia, with India leading the five other countries. For instance, India’s diesel exports tripled to ~1,600,000 barrels per day in March 2023, compared to a year ago, making diesel one of the largest components of India-EU trade.


 “Price cap coalition countries have increased imports of refined oil products from countries that have become the largest importers of Russian crude. This is a major loophole that can undermine the impact of the sanctions on Russia,” said the report.  According to the CREA report, most oil products were exported from two ports in Gujarat, alleging that this could constitute “circumventing sanctions” imposed unilaterally by the U.S. and Europe. India has particularly been offering a back-door for imports of Russian oil into Britain, blunting the country’s efforts to restrict funding for the Kremlin. Some British buyers have effectively replaced imports directly from Russia with imports from Russian-fed refineries, thereby indirectly supporting the Russian oil industry.  Although such a supply chain is actually legal under UK rules, still it cannot be overlooked because this is another covert way to fund Putin’s war. Before the war began nearly a year ago, it was pretty rare for Indian refiners to process Russian crude. The refiners have always exported to Europe, but they are now exporting even more because it’s more attractive as Europe’s diesel prices are higher and also buying more Russian crude because Russia is offering heavy discounts. Indeed, Oleg Ustenko, adviser to Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky, says these companies are “exploiting weaknesses in the sanctions regime”. “The UK must close the loopholes that undermine support for Ukraine by allowing bloody fossil fuels to continue flowing across our borders. About one in five barrels of the crude oil that they process is Russian. A big chunk of that diesel they produce now will be based on Russian crude oil,’’ he has said.


 Kpler data has revealed that the Jamnagar refinery on India’s west coast imported 215 shipments of crude oil and fuel oil from Russia during 2022, 4 times as much as it bought in the previous year. Meanwhile, the UK has imported a total of 10m barrels of diesel and other refined products from Jamnagar since the war began, 2.5 times what it bought during 2021 with Trafigura, Shell Plc (NYSE: SHEL), BP Plc (NYSE: BP), PetroChina Co. (OTCPK: PCYYF) and Indian multinational conglomerate Essar Group the key buyers."
Next Year Will Be A Crucial Year For Surinames Emerging Oil Boom.html,"A series of setbacks emerged during 2022 which derailed deeply impoverished Suriname’s nascent oil boom. The former Dutch colony of around 600,000 people, which shares the Guyana Suriname Basin with nearby Guyana, is believed to possess significant offshore petroleum potential. It is estimated that 1.4-million-acre offshore Block 58 where 50% partners Apache and TotalEnergies, which is the operator, have made five commercial discoveries, contains as much as 6.5 billion barrels of oil. If proven correct and successfully exploited, this will endow Suriname with a massive economic boom on the scale of that being enjoyed by Guyana where the economy grew by a stunning 62% during 2022. For these reasons, a fiscally challenged government in Paramaribo, which is facing an economic crisis and the threats of yet another sovereign debt default, views Suriname’s offshore oil potential as an economic silver bullet. It appears, however, that the former Dutch colony’s nascent oil boom is stalled. The final investment decision from Apache and TotalEnergies, which is the operator, regarding the billion-dollar development of Block 58 offshore Suriname was expected last year but has been delayed. TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne explained during late-2022 that the energy supermajor was concerned by a lack of understanding of the reservoirs discovered and a mismatch between seismic data and drilling results. This has postponed the first oil from Block 58 to at least 2027, perhaps even later, when it had initially been expected by Paramaribo in two years. When it is considered that it will take an investment of somewhere between $6 billion and $10 billion to develop Block 58 and bring it to first oil TotalEnergies hesitance is understandable.

 This constituted a serious blow for deeply embattled President Chandrikapersad Santokhi who is facing political and economic crises in a nation which is one of the poorest in South America. Suriname’s 2022 gross domestic product per capita of $5,710 the third lowest on the continent before Bolivia with Venezuela in last place. The former Dutch colony was hit particularly hard by the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic which exposed the economic weaknesses created by Dési Bouterse who was in power from 2010 to 2020. During 2020, Suriname’s gross domestic production shrank by 16% which was the worst performance in South America after Venezuela. Since then, the economy has failed to recover with 2021 GDP falling almost 3% and then only expanding by a mere 1.3% during 2022 when other South American countries were enjoying robust growth. More alarming is that the economic crisis sparked by the pandemic saw Suriname default three times on its sovereign debt and the country is facing the prospect of yet another default. In an attempt to shore up Paramaribo’s shaky finances, President Santokhi secured a nearly $700 million financing program from the International Monetary Fund, which was awarded on the condition of the government implementing harsh economic reforms. Those included removing fuel and electricity subsidies as part of a homegrown economic plan to restore fiscal and economic stability. This has only worsened the plight of everyday people in the impoverished South American country where inflation spiraled to 58% during February 2023. The soaring cost of living sparked violent anti-government demonstrations during February 2023 with protestors storming Suriname’s parliament. These events are magnifying the crises facing President Santokhi’s administration and the urgency with which a solution must be found. Paramaribo had expected an offshore oil boom to resolve Suriname’s economic woes, but there are signs that the FID for Block 58 is still some way off. Even after TotalEnergies demurred on making the FID during 2022 there were government expectations that it would be made during 2023, which could have seen first oil from Block 58 delivered by as early as 2027. It now appears that the FID will be made during 2024 (Dutch) at the earliest, but it could be delayed further if drilling results and flow testing do not meet expectations. The FID was delayed in part due to a series of non-commercial oil discoveries and dry wells. The latest poor drilling result was at the Awari well which was completed in November 2022 and deemed non-commercial, plugged and abandoned. Since then, Apache announced the successful drilling and flow testing of the Sapakara South-2 appraisal well which found 118 feet of net oil pay in what was deemed to be a high quality reservoir. Flow test and pressure data indicates that there are more than 200 million barrels of oil in place adding substantial resources to any planned development. Those results according to Apache CEO John J. Christmann IV confirm the company’s pre-drill expectations as well as geologic, geophysical, and reservoir models. That comes on the back of the June 2022 announcement of successful flow testing of the Krabdagu Discovery Well and the Sapakara South-1 appraisal well during November 2021.                                            


 Appraisal work is continuing on Block 58. The Krabdagu-2 appraisal was being drilled at the time of Apache’s February press release and will be followed by the Krabdagu-3 well which was scheduled to be spudded during February 2023. If Apache and TotalEnergies continue to experience the success reported during February 2023 then it is foreseeable that the FID for Block 58 will be made next year. Nonetheless, with it likely to take at least three years and potentially longer, to bring the block to first oil this could very well be too late for President Santokhi with a debt crisis and further civil unrest looming. Time is running out for Suriname to successfully exploit the considerable oil potential which lies offshore as the push to decarbonize the world economy gains momentum. This is amplified by the strict fiscal terms of Suriname’s oil production agreements and the impoverished country’s political instability."
Western Insurers May Inadvertedly Help To Ship Russian Crude.html,"Western tanker insurers are concerned that they may inadvertently help ship Russian crude oil above the $60 per barrel price cap as purchases and transactions have become opaque since the G7 introduced the price ceiling in early December 2022.   Protection and indemnity (P&I) clubs have attestation that the shipments they are covering have not been bought above the price cap, but they are wary that increasingly evasive practices by Russia and its new crude customers may obscure the actual price at which Russian crude cargoes are being traded.    


 As international oil prices rose after the surprise OPEC+ cuts announced in early April, the price of Russia's flagship crude grade, Urals, has ticked up to approach $60 per barrel. The ESPO grade, shipped from the Russian Far East port of Kozmino, has been consistently trading above $60 per barrel ever since the EU embargo and the EU/G7 price cap came into effect on December 5.  In recent weeks, warnings from the U.S. Treasury Department have advised U.S. and other Western insurers that they may have breached the price cap mechanism in shipments out of Kozmino.  Overall, Western insurers cannot be sure whether they have covered cargoes of crude sold above $60 per barrel.   ""We are definitely not able to assess the oil prices of shipments,"" Lars Lange, secretary general of the International Union of Marine Insurance, told Reuters this week.  Ship owners and maritime cargo insurers cannot reliably assess the actual price of a Russian cargo, Mike Salthouse, head of external affairs at NorthStandard P&I Club, told Reuters.  ""If Russia wants to export its oil and sell it above the price of the price cap, then it's in the interests of both the Russian exporter and the receiver not to release information as to what the true price of the cargo was,"" Salthouse told Reuters.   Related: Chevron Beats Profit Estimates As Refining Margins Jump Earlier this month, the U.S. Treasury Department published a warning to U.S. companies about possible evasion of the price cap, pointing specifically to ESPO shipments from Kozmino.  ""OFAC is aware of reports that ESPO and other crudes exported via Pacific ports in the Russian Federation, such as Kozmino, may be trading above the price cap and may be using covered services provided by U.S. persons,"" the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said. 


 ""These U.S. service providers may be unaware that they are providing covered services involving Russian oil purchased above the price cap, as the non-U.S. persons involved in the exports may have provided incomplete or false documentation or used other deceptive practices.""   Essentially all transactions for Russian crude at the Baltic Sea ports of Primorsk and Ust-Luga as well as the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk were conducted below the price cap in the first quarter of 2023. But more than 95% of crude volumes exported from Kozmino were priced above $60 per barrel, researchers at KSE Institute, a part of the Kyiv School of Economics, wrote in a report this week. The export price of Russian oil out of Kozmino averaged $73 per barrel, they noted.  ""The fact that a substantial share of voyages from Kozmino involves Western-owned and/or -insured vessels while essentially all transactions show prices above $60/barrel points to potentially considerable price cap violations,"" the researchers at the Ukraine-based institute said.  While the sanctions regime appears to be working in reducing Putin's oil revenues—with crude oil and oil product exports down by $15.6 billion for the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, ""export prices for Russian crude oil in 2023Q1 point to sanctions violations and underscore the urgent need for more rigorous enforcement,"" the researchers added.  Ship owners and insurers face even more complications in handling Russian crude if the Urals price stays above $60 per barrel, as it has been for most of April, analysts say.  ""If the price of Russian crude remains demonstrably over the $60 per barrel price cap, the situation can become more complicated,"" Erik Broekhuizen, manager of marine research and consulting at Poten & Partners, said in a recent research note.

 ADVERTISEMENT The price cap has also spurred a rise in the 'dark' or 'shadow' fleet of oil tankers, which now includes tankers not only shipping sanctioned Iranian and Venezuelan oil, but also increasingly larger volumes of Russian oil and products.    ""More than 440 tankers above 30,000 dwt tonnes, with an average age of 20 years, have been identified as solely deployed in shipping Iranian, Venezuelan and Russian oil, with beneficial owners hiding behind byzantine corporate structures,"" a Lloyd's List analysis showed last month.  ""The number has increased by over 180 tankers in the past 12 months, as Western sanctions on Russian oil imports and shipments to third countries drive the expansion of shadowy and unregulated maritime transport."" "
